‘A cat may look at a king,’ said Alice.	39
‘A fine day, your Majesty!’ the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.	67
‘A quarter to two,’ he said, looking at the parlour clock.	58
‘Ah, what is it, now?’ the Unicorn cried eagerly.	49
‘Ahem!’ said the Mouse with an important air, ‘are you all ready?’	66
‘And how did you manage on the twelfth?’ Alice went on eagerly.	63
‘And washing?’ said the Mock Turtle.	36
‘Anything you like,’ said the Footman, and began whistling.	59
‘Are their heads off?’ shouted the Queen.	41
‘Are there many crabs here?’ said Alice.	40
‘Are you animal—vegetable—or mineral?’ he said, yawning at every other word.	76
‘Blew—me—up,’ panted the Queen, who was still a little out of breath.	69
‘But I’m not a serpent, I tell you!’ said Alice.	48
‘But I’m not used to it!’ pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone.	63
‘But about his toes?’ the Mock Turtle persisted.	48
‘But she must have a prize herself, you know,’ said the Mouse.	62
‘Call it what you like,’ said the Cat.	38
‘Call the next witness!’ said the King.	39
‘Certainly not!’ said Alice indignantly.	40
‘Change lobsters again!’ it yelled at the top of its voice.	59
‘Collar that Dormouse,’ the Queen shrieked out.	47
‘Come, let’s try the first figure!’ said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon.	72
‘Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!’ thought Alice.	53
‘Consider your verdict,’ he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.	72
‘Did you say pig, or fig?’ said the Cat.	40
‘Did you say “What a pity!”?’ the Rabbit asked.	47
‘Digging for apples, indeed!’ said the Rabbit angrily.	54
‘Does the boots and shoes!’ she repeated in a wondering tone.	61
‘Each with a lobster as a partner!’ it cried.	45
‘Exactly so,’ said Alice.	25
‘Faster!’ and dragged her along.	32
‘Feather!’ cried the Sheep, as she took up another pair of needles.	67
‘Fifteenth,’ said the March Hare.	33
‘Fivepence farthing for one—Twopence for two,’ the Sheep replied.	65
‘Fourteenth of March, I think it was,’ he said.	47
‘Give your evidence,’ said the King.	36
‘Good-bye, till we meet again!’ she said as cheerfully as she could.	68
‘Hand it over here,’ said the Dodo.	35
‘Have some wine,’ the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.	61
‘He must have imitated somebody else’s hand,’ said the King.	60
‘Herald, read the accusation!’ said the King.	45
‘Hold your tongue!’ it added, before Alice could speak again.	61
‘How am I to get in?’ asked Alice again, in a louder tone.	58
‘How can I have done that?’ she thought.	40
‘How can she knit with so many?’ the puzzled child thought to herself.	70
‘How do you know I’m mad?’ said Alice.	38
‘How dreadfully savage!’ exclaimed Alice.	41
‘How should I know?’ said Alice, surprised at her own courage.	62
‘I am so sleepy?’ she moaned.	29
‘I beg your pardon?’ said Alice.	32
‘I call it purring, not growling,’ said Alice.	46
‘I don’t know what you mean,’ she said.	39
‘I don’t know,’ Alice said doubtfully.	38
‘I don’t much care where—’ said Alice.	38
‘I don’t see any wine,’ she remarked.	37
‘I like birthday presents best,’ she said at last.	50
‘I mean what I say,’ the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone.	65
‘I never bet half a dozen!’ said the other.	43
‘I never saw one, or heard of one,’ said Alice.	47
‘I only wish I had such eyes,’ the King remarked in a fretful tone.	67
‘I see somebody now!’ she exclaimed at last.	44
‘I should like to hear her try and repeat something now.	56
‘I should win easy,’ said the Lion.	35
‘I talk English, don’t I?’ the Frog went on.	44
‘I thought it would,’ said the Cat, and vanished again.	55
‘I thought you did,’ said the Mouse.	36
‘I wish I knew!’ thought poor Alice.	36
‘I wonder how many miles I’ve fallen by this time?’ she said aloud.	67
‘If I’d meant that, I’d have said it,’ said Humpty Dumpty.	58
‘It all came different!’ the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully.	63
‘It always happens,’ said the gnat.	35
‘It began with blotting paper,’ the Knight answered with a groan.	65
‘It can’t be anybody else!’ she said to herself.	48
‘It does the boots and shoes,’ it replied very solemnly.	56
‘It gets easier further on,’ Humpty Dumpty replied.	51
‘It is striking four,’ I answered.	34
‘It is well you are out of my reach,’ he exclaimed.	51
‘It isn’t mine,’ said the Hatter.	33
‘It isn’t respectable to beg,’ said the King.	45
‘It must be a very pretty dance,’ said Alice timidly.	53
‘It proves nothing of the sort!’ said Alice.	44
‘It was the best butter,’ the March Hare meekly replied.	56
‘It’s a fabulous monster!’ the Unicorn cried out, before Alice could reply.	75
‘It’s exactly like a riddle with no answer!’ she thought.	57
‘It’s really dreadful,’ she muttered to herself, ‘the way all the creatures argue’.	83
‘It’s—it’s a very fine day!’ said a timid voice at her side.	60
‘I’d rather see that done on paper,’ he said.	45
‘I’ll fetch the executioner myself,’ said the King eagerly, and he hurried off.	79
‘I’m a poor man, your Majesty,’ he began.	41
‘I’m not a mile high,’ said Alice.	34
‘I’m not a serpent!’ said Alice indignantly.	44
‘I’m not a visitor, and I’m not a servant.	42
‘I’m not offended,’ said Humpty Dumpty.	39
‘I’m not so sure of that,’ said the Unicorn.	44
‘I’ve got it!’ she cried in a triumphant tone.	46
‘Keep your temper,’ said the Caterpillar.	41
‘Leave off that!’ screamed the Queen.	37
‘Look, look!’ she cried, pointing eagerly.	42
‘Must a name mean something?’ Alice asked doubtfully.	53
‘Nearly there!’ the Queen repeated.	35
‘Nearly two miles high,’ added the Queen.	41
‘Never mind!’ said the King, with an air of great relief.	57
‘Never!’ said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard as she spoke.	83
‘No, Mr. Lockwood,’ said Nelly, shaking her head.	49
‘No, no!’ said the Queen.	25
‘No,’ said the Caterpillar.	27
‘Nobody,’ said the messenger.	29
‘Nonsense!’ said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was silent.	76
‘Not at all,’ gruffly remarked the elder man.	45
‘Not yet, not yet!’ the Rabbit hastily interrupted.	51
‘Not yet,’ said the Knight.	27
‘Nothing!’ Alice said impatiently.	34
‘Now, Kitty!’ she cried, clapping her hands triumphantly.	57
‘Of course twinkling begins with a T!’ said the King sharply.	61
‘Of course,’ the Dodo replied very gravely.	43
‘Off with her head!’ the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.	63
‘Oh, don’t talk about trouble!’ said the Duchess.	49
‘Oh, hush!’ the Rabbit whispered in a frightened tone.	54
‘Oh, no, Sir,’ replied Mary eagerly.	36
‘Oh, you can’t help that,’ said the Cat: ‘we’re all mad here’.	62
‘Oh, you foolish Alice!’ she answered herself.	46
‘Oh, you sing,’ it said.	24
‘One, indeed!’ said the Dormouse indignantly.	45
‘Only a thimble,’ said Alice sadly.	35
‘Open the bag!’ he whispered.	29
‘Sap and sawdust,’ said the gnat.	33
‘Serpent!’ screamed the Pigeon.	31
‘Seven years and six months!’ Humpty Dumpty repeated thoughtfully.	66
‘She boxed the Queen’s ears—’ the Rabbit began.	47
‘She can’t do addition,’ the Red Queen interrupted.	51
‘She can’t explain it,’ it said hastily.	40
‘She’s coming!’ cried the Larkspur.	35
‘She’s grown a good deal!’ was her first remark.	48
‘She’s my prisoner, you know!’ the Red Knight said at last.	59
‘She’s tired, poor thing!’ said the Red Queen.	46
‘Sixteenth,’ added the Dormouse.	32
‘So much obliged!’ added Tweedledee.	36
‘Speak when you’re spoken to!’ The Queen sharply interrupted her.	65
‘Speak, can’t you?’ he cried impatiently.	41
‘Stand up and repeat “‘Tis the voice of the sluggard,”’ it said.	64
‘Suppose we change the subject,’ the March Hare interrupted, yawning.	69
‘Swim after them!’ it screamed.	31
‘Take off your hat,’ the King said to the Hatter.	49
‘Thank you,’ said Alice, ‘it’s very interesting’.	49
‘That proves his guilt,’ said the Queen.	40
‘That’s just what I complain of,’ said Humpty Dumpty.	53
‘That’s none of your business, Two!’ said Seven.	48
‘That’s right!’ said the Tiger-lily.	36
‘That’s right!’ shouted the Queen.	34
‘That’s very curious!’ she thought.	35
‘The daisies are worst of all.	30
‘Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!’ the soldiers shouted in reply.	81
‘Then if the dog went away, its temper would remain!’ the Queen exclaimed triumphantly.	87
‘Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,’ said the Cat.	56
‘Then it wasn’t very civil of you to offer it,’ said Alice angrily.	67
‘Then the Dormouse shall!’ they both cried.	43
‘There’s nothing but hay left now,’ the Messenger said, peeping into the bag.	77
‘They are going to the Grange, then?’ I said.	45
‘They lived on treacle,’ said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or two.	75
‘Thinking again?’ the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp little chin.	79
‘Three hundred and sixty-five,’ said Alice.	43
‘Tickets, please!’ said the Guard, putting his head in at the window.	69
‘To answer the door?’ he said.	30
‘To guard against the bites of sharks,’ the Knight replied.	59
‘Treacle,’ said a sleepy voice behind her.	42
‘Treacle,’ said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.	67
‘Turn a somersault in the sea!’ cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly about.	77
‘Very much indeed,’ said Alice.	31
‘Very true,’ said the Duchess: ‘flamingoes and mustard both bite’.	66
‘Very,’ said Alice: ‘—where’s the Duchess?’	43
‘Wake up, Dormouse!’ And they pinched it on both sides at once.	63
‘We wanted to plant some flowers there,’ she cried.	51
‘Well, only on Thursdays,’ said the Queen.	42
‘What a funny watch!’ she remarked.	35
‘What a number of cucumber-frames there must be!’ thought Alice.	64
‘What a thick black cloud that is!’ she said.	45
‘What are they doing?’ Alice whispered.	39
‘What can all that green stuff be?’ said Alice.	47
‘What do you call yourself?’ the Fawn said at last.	51
‘What else have you got in your pocket?’ he went on, turning to Alice.	70
‘What fun!’ it said, half to itself, half to Alice.	51
‘What impertinence!’ said the pudding.	38
‘What is it, now?’ the Frog said in a deep hoarse whisper.	58
‘What is the fun?’ said Alice.	30
‘What size do you want to be?’ it asked.	40
‘What sort of things do you remember best?’ Alice ventured to ask.	66
‘What was that?’ inquired Alice.	32
‘What’s that you say?’ - pretending that the kitten was speaking.	65
‘Where do you come from?’ said the Red Queen.	45
‘Where shall I begin, please your Majesty?’ he asked.	53
‘Which door?’ said the Frog.	28
‘Who are you?’ said the Caterpillar.	36
‘Who’s making personal remarks now?’ the Hatter asked triumphantly.	67
‘Why the Lion and the Unicorn, of course,’ said the King.	57
‘Why, because there’s nobody with me!’ cried Humpty Dumpty.	59
‘Why, she,’ it said.	20
‘Would you like to see a little of it?’ said the Mock Turtle.	61
‘Yes!’ shouted Alice.	21
‘Yes, please do!’ pleaded Alice.	32
‘Yes, pretty well—some poetry,’ Alice said doubtfully.	54
‘Yes,’ said Alice, ‘we learned French and music.’	49
‘You did,’ said the Mock Turtle.	32
‘You’d better not talk!’ said Five.	35
‘You’re a very poor speaker,’ said the King.	44
‘You’re holding it upside down!’ Alice interrupted.	51
‘You’re thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk.	77
‘You’ve been wrong!’ cried Tweedledum.	38
‘You’ve missed the soup and fish,’ she said.	44
“A bet,” I said.	16
“A ripping speech,” he said.	28
“And that’s all I get,” he moaned.	34
“At your service,” he said politely.	36
“Bob’s got to go to town tonight,” he added, turning to me.	59
“But I’m a strong teetotaller,” he said pugnaciously.	53
“How Nellie will chuckle,” said the plump man.	46
“I am afraid he must put off his journey,” I said.	50
“I want a word with you.” And I led him into the dining-room.	61
“I want to write books,” he said.	33
“Look at the time,” said the old man.	37
“Mining engineer,” I said.	26
“Mr Scudder...” I stammered.	28
“Oh, damn,” said the young man.	31
“Pardon,” he said, “I’m a bit rattled tonight”.	47
“Stop that row, Paddock,” I said.	33
“That’s what comes of being a teetotaller,” he observed in bitter regret.	73
“The boy’s uncle is down there,” said Jip quietly.	50
“There’s two chaps below looking for you,” he whispered.	56
“Was it as bad as that?” he asked ruefully.	43
“Where did you find out this story?” I asked.	45
“Yes and no,” he said.	22
“Your paper woke them up,” he said gleefully.	45
“You’re the right sort of fellow,” he said.	43
“You’re young to be an innkeeper,” I said.	42

In zoology, the Principle of Coordination is one of the guiding principles of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature.	128
It states that the act of publishing a new zoological name thereby automatically and simultaneously establishes all the corresponding names in the relevant other ranks, with the same type.	188
The same applies to the name of a subspecies; this establishes the corresponding species name.	94
In the family-group, publication of the name of a family, subfamily, superfamily also establishes the names in all the other ranks in the family group.	151
Author citations for such names are the same as for the name actually published.	80
It is immaterial if there is an actual taxon to which the automatically established name applies; if ever such a taxon is recognised, there is a name available for it.	167

Total metal jacket bullets are made by electroplating a thin jacket of ductile metal over a core of different metal requiring protection from abrasion or corrosion.	164
Similar full metal jacket bullets mechanically swage a thin sheet of metal over the core.	89

Thinner electroplated jackets may not be as strong as conventional swaged jackets of similar metal, and may not prevent leading at higher bullet velocities.	156
Thinner jackets may be damaged by and foul barrel ports for gas-operated reloading or recoil compensation.	106

h or aquatic amphibians can detect electric fields using specialized electroreceptors to detect and to locate the source of an external electric field in its environment creating the electric field.	198
nal electric fields can be produced by any bioelectrical process in an organism, especially by actions of the nerves or muscles of fish, or indeed by the specially developed electric organs of fish.	198
Other fields are induced by movement of a conducting organism through the earth's magnetic field, or from atmospheric electricity.	130
Electrolocating fish use this ability to detect prey, locate other fish, avoid predators, and navigate by the Earth's magnetic field.	133
evolved once or twice early in vertebrate evolution, but the sense was apparently lost in amniotes, and in a large number of the Actinopterygii only to reappear independently in two teleost clades.	197
In fish, the ampullary receptor is a specialized receptor that it uses to sense these electric fields and allows the fish to follow electric field lines to their source.	169
Sharks primarily use specialized receptors, called Ampullae of Lorenzini, to detect their prey's low frequency DC fields and may also use their receptors in navigation by the Earth's magnetic field.	198
Weakly electric fish use their ampullary receptors and tuberous receptors to detect the weakly electric fields produced by other fish, as well as for possible predator avoidance.	178
ion contrasts with active electrolocation, in which the animal emits its own weak self generated electric field and detects nearby objects by detecting the distortion of its produced electric field.	198
600 species are known to be electroreceptive.	45

The generic name derives from Latin acuto and Latin ramus , referring to the acute angle of the final tooth of the claws relative to the rest of the claw.	154
Many pterygotid eurypterids, such as Jaekelopterus and Pterygotus, grew to gigantic proportions.	96
bohemicus, surpassing two metres in length.	43
Other giant pterygotid eurypterids, such as Jaekelopterus and Pterygotus, were very visually acute in a similar way to modern predatory arthropods and possessed robust and crushing chelae.	188
Studies on the compound eyes and chelicerae of Acutiramus has revealed that it would have had a comparably low visual acuity and claws adapted for slicing and shearing, rather than crushing.	190

Taepodong-1 was a three-stage technology demonstrator developed by North Korea, a development step toward an intermediate-range ballistic missile.	146
The missile was derived originally from the Scud rocket and was tested once in nineteen ninety eight as a space launch vehicle.	127
On August 31, 1998, North Korea announced that they had used this rocket to launch their first satellite Kwangmyŏngsŏng-1 from a pad on the Musudan-ri peninsula.	161
However, the satellite failed to achieve orbit; outside observers conjecture that the additional third stage either failed to fire or malfunctioned.	148
This is contrary to official statements of the North Korean state media, which stated that the satellite achieved orbit about five minutes after launch.	152
On this single launch, the main two-stage booster flew for 1,646 km without any significant problems.	101
The rocket was launched eastward, passing over Japan at an altitude of over two hundred km.	91
The second stage came down into the Pacific Ocean about sixty km past Japan, and the third stage about six hundred km beyond Japan.	131
According to post-launch analysis of the launch vehicle, debris from the third stage fell as far as 4,000 kilometers from the launch pad.	137
Some analysts believe that a three-stage space booster variant of the Taepodong-1 could be capable of travelling as far as 5,900 kilometers with a very small payload.	166
In two thousand, three the US Defense Intelligence Agency reported to the Congress: "We have no information to suggest Pyongyang intends to deploy the Taepo Dong one as a surface-to-surface missile in North Korea.	213
Waterpistol is the second studio album by English alternative rock band Shack.	78
The album was recorded in 1991, but its release was delayed due to a studio fire which destroyed the master tapes.	114
During the period between the album's recording and release, the band broke up and frontman Mick Head became addicted to heroin.	128
Ultimately, Waterpistol was well received by critics.	53
The album was reissued in two thousand, seven in expanded form by The Red Flag Recording Company.	97
Shack's nineteen eighty eight debut album, Zilch, was a commercial flop upon its release.	89
Critical consensus was that Head's songwriting was promising but that the album's production was lacking.	105
90, frontman Mick Head told NME that Shack's second album would be less lyrically serious than Zilch and that the band's influences at the time were The Stone Roses, Flowered Up, and The Charlatans.	198
Tabaré Hackenbruch was an Uruguayan politician.	47
A member of the Colorado Party, he started his long political career supporting the successful candidacy of Tomás Berreta for President.	136

Paraformaldehyde is the smallest polyoxymethylene, the polymerization product of formaldehyde with a typical degree of polymerization of 8–100 units.	149
Paraformaldehyde commonly has a slight odor of formaldehyde due to decomposition.	81
Paraformaldehyde is a poly-acetal.	34
Paraformaldehyde forms slowly in aqueous formaldehyde solutions as a white precipitate, especially if stored in the cold.	121
Formalin actually contains very little monomeric formaldehyde; most of it forms short chains of polyformaldehyde.	113
A small amount of methanol is often added as a stabilizer to limit the extent of polymerization.	96
Paraformaldehyde can be depolymerized to formaldehyde gas by dry heating and to formaldehyde solution by water in the presence of a base or heat.	145
The high purity formaldehyde solutions obtained in this way are used as a fixative for microscopy and histology.	112
The resulting formaldehyde gas from dry heating paraformaldehyde is flammable.	78
Once paraformaldehyde is depolymerized, the resulting formaldehyde may be used as a fumigant, disinfectant, fungicide, and fixative.	132

Diseased tissues are often stiffer than the surrounding normal tissue.	70
For instance, breast cancers are much harder than healthy fibroglandular tissue.	80
This characteristic has been used by physicians for screening and diagnosis of many diseases, through palpation.	112
MRE calculates the mechanical parameter as elicited by palpation, in a non-invasive and objective way.	102
Magnetic resonance elastography works by using an additional gradient waveform in the pulse sequence to sensitize the MRI scan to shear waves in the tissue.	156
The shear waves are generated by an electro-mechanical transducer on the surface of the skin.	93
Both the mechanical excitation and the motion sensitizing gradient are at the same frequency.	93
This encodes the amplitude of the shear wave in the tissue in the phase of the MRI image.	89
An algorithm can be used to extract a quantitative measure of tissue stiffness from the MRI in an elastogram.	109
Magnetic resonance elastography was first introduced by Muthupillai et al.	74
in nineteen ninety five and is being investigated to be used for a multitude of diseases that affect the tissue stiffness.	122
It has been used clinically for the assessment of liver fibrosis.	65

album is to be a more "upbeat" follow up to their previous album Bears, Mayors, Scraps & Bones, with vocalist Liam Cormier saying the album was lyrically far too dark for what the band wanted to do.	198
In December 2011, Liam Cormier was asked about whether the groups sound has change much.	88
"I think sound-wise there's definitely more of the natural evolution of how gnarly we keep getting and how more refined everyone sounds.	136
I'd say the majority of our fans now have seen our band live and know how gnarly and ferocious it is, so trying to compress that into a recording still is kind of difficult.	173
Like we'd say 'I thought we did it pretty well on Bears', and then we'd re-examine it and see there's still some elements that are missing.	139
"The band's influences steered away from the "traditional hardcore record" and took a wide variety of influences from indie rock bands like Fleet Foxes.	152
Cormier, when asked about his influences, stated: "In a lot of ways we get really inspired by non-metal bands.	110
For me, I find I really like looking at other things because I just don't want to make a traditional hardcore record lyrically.	127

Vladislav Bogićević is a Serbian retired football player.	57
He is a member of the American National Soccer Hall of Fame.	60
Bogićević's playing career included thirteen seasons with Red Star Belgrade where he was part of five Yugoslav league winning teams.	132
Throughout his time at Red Star he was known by nickname Bleki.	63
With his confident play for Red Star, Bogićević garnered interest from several European clubs.	94
However, strict sporting rules of communist Yugoslavia stating that no player could move abroad until the start of calendar year in which he turns twenty eight prevented the transfer from taking place.	201
In January 1978, technically still at the age of 27, Bogićević joined the New York Cosmos of the North American Soccer League.	126

nance logging is a type of well logging that uses the NMR response of a formation to directly determine its porosity and permeability, providing a continuous record along the length of the borehole.	198
NMR logging exploits the large magnetic moment of hydrogen, which is abundant in rocks in the form of water.	108
The NMR signal amplitude is proportional to the quantity of hydrogen nuclei present in a formation and can be calibrated to give a value for porosity that is free from lithology effects.	186
Uniquely, a petrophysicist can also analyse the rate of decay of the NMR signal amplitude to obtain information on the permeability of the formation - a crucial quantity in hydrocarbon exploration.	197
The most important mechanism affecting NMR relaxation is grain-surface relaxation.	82
Molecules in fluids are in constant Brownian motion, diffusing about the pore space and bouncing off the grain surfaces.	120
laxation most significantly depends on how often the hydrogen nuclei collide with the grain surface and this is controlled by the surface-to-volume ratio of the pore in which the nuclei are located.	198
Collisions are less frequent in larger pores, resulting in a slower decay of the NMR signal amplitude and allowing a petrophysicist to understand the distribution of pore sizes.	177

A shovel test pit is a standard method for Phase I of an archaeological survey.	79
It is usually a part of the Cultural Resources Management methodology and a popular form of rapid archaeological survey in the United States of America and Canada.	163
It designates a series of test holes, usually dug out by a shovel in order to determine whether the soil contains any cultural remains that are not visible on the surface.	171
The soil is sifted or screened through 1/4" or six mm wire mesh to recover the artifacts.	89
STPs will often be laid out over the project area in a grid-like fashion or in a consistently spaced line, creating a fairly systematic survey.	143
Therefore, after the holes have been dug, one may map artifact densities over the project area, pinpointing the locations of possible sites where further investigation may be necessary.	185
The interval at which the STPs are placed varies considerably and, in CRM at least, is sometimes prescribed by state regulations or is determined by the conditions in the field.	177
The current standards in the United States is 30m or less.	58

In linguistics, sound symbolism, phonesthesia or phonosemantics is the idea that vocal sounds or phonemes carry meaning in and of themselves.	141
However, it is Ferdinand de Saussure who is considered to be the founder of modern 'scientific' linguistics.	108
use to indicate things and concepts could be any words — they are essentially just a consensus agreed upon by the speakers of a language and have no discernible pattern or relationship to the thing.	198
Second, he says that, because words are arbitrary, they have meaning only in relation to other words.	101
A dog is a dog because it is not a cat or a mouse or a horse, etc.	66
These ideas have permeated the study of words since the 19th century.	69
Margaret Magnus is the author of a comprehensive book designed to explain phonosemantics to the lay reader: Gods in the Word.	125
This is the least significant type of symbolism.	48

"Dance " is a song by the British rock band the Rolling Stones.	63
Written by Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, and Ronnie Wood, the song evolved out of a single riff.	95
The song appeared as the opening track on the band's nineteen eighty album Emotional Rescue.	92
The song is one of the first Rolling Stones tracks to have been co-written by Ronnie Wood, who is credited with coming up with the original riff for the song.	158
1' was one strong riff where Mick immediately took the bait, literally got up and danced to it, which was the whole idea of the track: it's a catchy riff.	154
That was an example of a song that originated without words, just a groove with various changes, but never a chorus.	116

The tensors of electrical resistivity, permeability, etc.	57
have two independent constants.	31
An example of a transversely isotropic material is the so-called on-axis unidirectional fiber composite lamina where the fibers are circular in cross section.	158
In a unidirectional composite, the plane normal to the fiber direction can be considered as the isotropic plane, at long wavelengths of excitation.	147
In the figure to the right, the fibers would be aligned with the    x   two    {\displaystyle x_{2}} axis, which is normal to the plane of isotropy.	148
In terms of effective properties, geological layers of rocks are often interpreted as being transversely isotropic.	115

the object that the ephemeron guards, notifying the system when that object is collectable, and the value can be any data associated with the object such as a property list, and which may be empty.	197
Since the elements of the property list may refer back to the key, they may prevent collection of that key.	107
But the ephemeron is treated specially by the garbage collector.	64
The value field is not traced until the key is found to be reachable from the system roots other than through ephemeron keys.	125
t of ephemerons whose keys are only reachable from ephemeron keys are then holding onto keys that are ready to be collected; these objects are not reachable from the roots except through ephemerons.	198
When the garbage collector detects such a set, the ephemerons are queued for notification and their keys and values are traced.	127
Hence ephemerons both detect objects that are ready for collection and break the cycles that can prevent objects from being collected.	134

The Vision Montreal Crisis of nineteen ninety seven was one of the most severe internal party crises in Montreal politics.	122
In January 1997, Mayor Pierre Bourque tried to dismiss two members of Montreal's Executive Committee: Deputy Chairman Sammy Forcillo and Pierre Goyer.	150
Yet, the city charter of nineteen twenty one clearly states that appointments to the Executive Committee are irrevocable.	121
Forcillo and Goyer left Vision Montreal to sit as independents, but exercised their right to stay on the committee.	115
Therefore, management by consensus became nearly impossible to reach for the remainder of Bourque's term.	105
That incident as well as allegations of authoritarian tendencies led thirteen other Vision Montreal councillors to leave the party and sit as independents with their colleagues of the opposition.	195
By August 1997, only a minority of the council members were members of Vision Montreal and the credibility of the Bourque administration was undermined.	152
efectors were supporters of Jacques Duchesneau's Nouveau Montréal party, but others backed Jean Doré's Équipe Montréal, the RCM or even came back to Vision Montreal briefly before the next election.	198

Archaeological excavations have shown that in the place of Gamla there was already a settlement in the Early Bronze Age.	120
The settlement was probably agricultural, as archaeologists have found evidence of long-term use of flint sickles.	114
Some of the findings even go back to the Copper Age.	52
Around two thousand, seven hundred BCE, the settlement was abandoned until it was used as a military outpost by the Seleucids.	126
According to the Mishnah, the town of Gamla was encompassed by a wall before the Israelite conquest of Canaan under Joshua.	123
Modern-day archaeologists have suggested that the fort was abandoned before the arrival of the Israelites, which, even if that were the case, has no bearing on the antiquity of the wall itself.	193

In compiler theory, partial redundancy elimination is a compiler optimization that eliminates expressions that are redundant on some but not necessarily all paths through a program.	181
PRE is a form of common subexpression elimination.	50
An expression is called partially redundant if the value computed by the expression is already available on some but not all paths through a program to that expression.	168
An expression is fully redundant if the value computed by the expression is available on all paths through the program to that expression.	138
minate partially redundant expressions by inserting the partially redundant expression on the paths that do not already compute it, thereby making the partially redundant expression fully redundant.	198
For instance, in the following code:the expression x+4 assigned to z is partially redundant because it is computed twice if some_condition is true.	147
de motion on the expression to yield the following optimized code:An interesting property of PRE is that it performs common subexpression elimination and loop-invariant code motion at the same time.	198
In addition, PRE can be extended to eliminate injured partial redundancies, thereby effectively performing strength reduction.	126
This makes PRE one of the most important optimizations in optimizing compilers.	79
s, but recently formulations of PRE based on static single assignment form have been published that apply the PRE algorithm to values instead of expressions, unifying PRE and global value numbering.	198

The M1877 was a short barreled breech-loading mortar.	53
The barrel was a typical built-up gun of the period with reinforcing hoops which was built from cast iron and steel.	116
The mortar had an early form of Krupp horizontal sliding-block breech and it fired separate-loading, bagged charges and projectiles.	132
ing a large shell at a high-angle was more likely to destroy an enemy ship by penetrating its thin deck armor than a high-velocity low-angle naval gun attempting to penetrate its thicker belt armor.	198
The downside was that high-angle indirect fire was harder to aim correctly so more mortars would be needed to defend an area from attack.	137
However, if the area was constrained by geography like a port at the mouth of a river the navigation channels could be measured ahead of time and firing ranges calculated.	171
A complicating factor was as naval artillery progressed their size and range soon eclipsed the mortar's range.	110

The mount consisted of a rectangular steel firing platform with a pivot at the front and two wheels at the rear to give a limited amount of traverse.	149

Vibration is a mechanical phenomenon whereby oscillations occur about an equilibrium point.	91
The oscillations may be periodic, such as the motion of a pendulum—or random, such as the movement of a tire on a gravel road.	126
Vibration can be desirable: for example, the motion of a tuning fork, the reed in a woodwind instrument or harmonica, a mobile phone, or the cone of a loudspeaker.	163
In many cases, however, vibration is undesirable, wasting energy and creating unwanted sound.	93
For example, the vibrational motions of engines, electric motors, or any mechanical device in operation are typically unwanted.	127
Such vibrations could be caused by imbalances in the rotating parts, uneven friction, or the meshing of gear teeth.	115
Careful designs usually minimize unwanted vibrations.	53
The studies of sound and vibration are closely related.	55

Romantic entanglements and the dissatisfactions of love remain a major concern and the novel maintains Powell's characteristic mingling of comedy and embarrassment.	164

oftware component of a network video recorder and digital video recorder, though in general a VMS tends to be more sophisticated and provide more options and capabilities than a packaged NVR device.	198
Due to improvements in technology, it is necessary to make a distinction between a VMS and the built-in features of modern network based security cameras.	154
However a camera's built-in web interface is typically exclusive to the camera itself and does not normally provide a shared access capability across other network cameras.	172
Optionally, a VMS may also provide additional features and capabilities.	72
The extent of these capabilities may be divided across several product tiers, with the lower cost VMS products having fewer features.	133
Rather than continuously recording data, a VMS may also implement motion detection to reduce the amount of data to be recorded.	127
With modern megapixel network cameras, the cameras are much more sophisticated.	79
Motion detection can now be distributed, so that the cameras do motion detection themselves and only send video when motion is detected.	136
Some VMS do not have motion detection and rely exclusively on it being done in the camera.	90
A difficulty with modern megapixel network cameras is the variety of standards and industry compliance with those standards.	124

in stream when frozen would show structures of beautifully shaped geometric design, but those structures would be distorted and randomly formed if the sample were taken from a polluted water source.	198

In 1923, the South African Railways experimented with gas-electric motive power and constructed a single experimental producer gas-electric locomotive.	151
emained in service for several years and was followed by another, built by the General Electric Company, which was not successful and never entered line service after undergoing experimental trials.	198
The gas-electric concept was eventually superseded by diesel-electric traction.	79
The non-profitability of many branch line operations had been a problem for the South African Railways from the outset.	119
n to the fact that, in isolated districts with vast agricultural and mineral capabilities in many parts of the Union of South Africa, development was hampered by the lack of means of transportation.	198
Diesel and diesel-electric locomotives were still in their infancy and were therefore not yet an attractive proposition, while the cost of electrification of such branch lines would be prohibitive.	197
During October 1922, Hoy encouraged further experiments to determine the practicability of the use of suction gas as fuel for an alternative form of motive power, suitable for use on branch lines.	196

Boraginoideae is a subfamily of the flowering plant family Boraginaceae, as that family is defined in the APG III system of classification for flowering plants.	160
The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group has not actually specified subfamilies within Boraginaceae.	90
Some taxonomists place the genera Codon and Wellstedia in Boraginoideae.	72
Others place one or both of these in separate, monogeneric subfamilies.	71
Codon was long regarded as an odd member of Hydrophylloideae, but in 1998, a molecular phylogenetic study showed that it is closer to Boraginoideae.	148
Many of the botanists who work with Boraginaceae do not follow the APG III system.	82

An anthelion is a rare optical phenomenon of the halo family.	61
It appears on the parhelic circle opposite to the sun as a faint white spot, not unlike a sundog, and may be crossed by an X-shaped pair of diffuse arcs.	153
How anthelia are formed is disputed.	36
g others, has argued they are not separate haloes, but simply where various haloes caused by horizontally oriented column-shaped ice crystals coincide on the parhelic circle to create a bright spot.	198
If this theory is correct, anthelia should only appear together with these other haloes.	88
However, anthelia occur unaccompanied by other plate crystal haloes, thus scientists have produced alternative explanations.	124
Visser proposed they form by two exterior light reflections in quadrangular prisms, while Robert Greenler has suggested two interior reflections in column-shaped crystals produces the phenomenon.	195
thelion area is usually sparse on haloes, in a complex display it features various rare optic phenomena: Flanking the anthelion on the parhelic circle are two 120° parhelia caused by plate crystals.	198
The Tricker and diffuse arcs are produced in singly oriented column crystals and form an Ankh-like shape passing through the anthelion.	135

Genderqueer fashion is fashion among genderqueer people that goes beyond common style conventions that usually associate certain colors and shapes with one of the two binary genders.	182
ceived by consumers as a fashion style that focuses on experimenting garments based on people's different body shapes instead of following the restrictions given by gendered clothing categorization.	198
Genderqueer style is characterized by the choice to not conform to gender norms assigned at birth.	98
Its purpose is to redefine what is considered feminine and masculine.	69
This differentiation between gender norms through clothing became preponderant during the nineteenth century and it mainly involved different fabrics, trims and constructions for different genders.	197
Those distinctions were meant to mirror gender roles in society as masculine clothing aimed to be practical while female fashion was perceived as purely aesthetic.	163
Therefore, there is a historical dimension to the association between fashion and gender identity.	98
y is recognized by the LGBT community as a very personal and subjective behaviour; genderqueer style is therefore intrinsically tied to identity, and as such, it includes a vast range of aesthetics.	198
idge between individual identity and society: the genderqueer fashion style tries to recode this relation, although encountering several restrictions in the mass production of commonly binary goods.	198
These restrictions denote the political nature of genderqueer fashion.	70
According to an article that featured the writer and activist Alok Vaid-Menon, fashion represents the inherent politics of each individual artist or human.	155
For genderqueer people, as for transgender people, whose life and relationship with the body is hardly acknowledged by society, existence itself is political.	158

Jumble ice is a phenomenon that occurs when ice atop a river or other flowing body of water fractures due to the different flow rates beneath the ice.	150
On a lake, pond, or other stationary body of water, ice forms undisturbed and generally does not move as long as the entire surface of the body of water is frozen.	163
When a river freezes, water flow typically continues beneath the ice, exerting pressure on it.	94
If the ice fractures, pieces of ice torn free by the river's current will collide with stationary or slower-moving pieces.	122
After becoming stuck in place, the loosened pieces of ice refreeze irregularly, causing a rough, or jumbled, surface.	117
In general, the faster a body of water flows beneath ice, the more likely it is to develop jumble ice.	102
Temperatures near the freezing point also tend to cause jumble ice, as the higher temperatures weaken the ice structure, allowing for more pieces to be torn free before refreezing.	180
The Yukon River in Alaska often exhibits jumble ice during the winter.	70
Jumble ice is a hazard for winter travelers, as the broken "ground" formed by the jumble ice can cause snowmachine accidents or injuries to sled dogs.	150

In geometry an equilateral pentagon is a polygon with five sides of equal length.	81
Its five internal angles, in turn, can take a range of sets of values, thus permitting it to form a family of pentagons.	120
The requirement is that all angles must add up to five hundred and forty degrees and must be between zero and three hundred and sixty degrees but not equal to one hundred and eighty degrees.	190
Four intersecting equal circles arranged in a closed chain are sufficient to determine a convex equilateral pentagon.	117
Each circle's center is one of four vertices of the pentagon.	61
The remaining vertex is determined by one of the intersection points of the first and the last circle of the chain.	115
It is possible to describe any convex equilateral pentagon with only two angles α and β with α ≥ β provided the fourth angle is the smallest of the rest of the angles.	167
Thus the general equilateral pentagon can be regarded as a bivariate function f where the rest of the angles can be obtained by using trigonometric relations.	158
The equilateral pentagon described in this manner will be unique up to a rotation in the plane.	95

narians, and three entirely parasitic groups: Cestoda, Trematoda and Monogenea; however, since the turbellarians have since been proven not to be monophyletic, this classification is now deprecated.	198
Free-living flatworms are mostly predators, and live in water or in shaded, humid terrestrial environments, such as leaf litter.	128
Cestodes and trematodes have complex life-cycles, with mature stages that live as parasites in the digestive systems of fish or land vertebrates, and intermediate stages that infest secondary hosts.	198
trematodes are excreted from their main hosts, whereas adult cestodes generate vast numbers of hermaphroditic, segment-like proglottids that detach when mature, are excreted, and then release eggs.	197
Unlike the other parasitic groups, the monogeneans are external parasites infesting aquatic animals, and their larvae metamorphose into the adult form after attaching to a suitable host.	186
However, analyses since the mid-1980s have separated out one subgroup, the Acoelomorpha, as basal bilaterians—closer to the original bilaterians than to any other modern groups.	177

When a sufficient amount of experience is obtained, the character "levels up", achieving the next stage of character development.	129

improve characters in discrete experience levels; in other games, such as GURPS and the World of Darkness games, experience points are spent on specific abilities or attributes chosen by the player.	198

As players gain more experience points, the amount of experience needed to gain abilities typically increases.	110

Thus, as the player character strengthens from gaining experience, they are encouraged to accept tasks that are commensurate with their improved abilities in order to advance.	175

Balcraig Castle stood on the western flank of Hatton Hill about half a mile south of the village of Newtyle, Angus, in the Sidlaw Hills.	136
Today no evidence remains of the structure save an area levelled off in the top left corner of the field in which it once stood.	128
The location was strategic as the castle guarded the route through the Sidlaw Hills at this natural cleft.	106
In thirteen ten seven King Robert the Bruce rewarded Sir William Oliphant, Lord of Aberdalgie with a number of grants of land including Gasknes, Newtyle, Kinpurnie, Auchtertyre, Balcrais, Muirhouse and Hazelhead.	212
It is not known when the castle of Balcraig was constructed but it was superseded in fifteen seventy five when Hatton Castle was erected by the 4th Lord Oliphant nearby.	169
The only known representation of Balcraig is in Timothy Pont's map of the area circa 1590, when it was still standing.	118
The size of the stones suggested that they were the foundations of a stone fortalice.	85
There is also a diary record of the blowing up of the castle at Newtyle.	72
Hatton Castle, although ruinous until it was restored in the 1980s, was still standing, rather, it had had some major repairs by its owners.	140

Numerical weather prediction uses mathematical models of the atmosphere and oceans to predict the weather based on current weather conditions.	142
Though first attempted in the 1920s, it was not until the advent of computer simulation in the 1950s that numerical weather predictions produced realistic results.	163
f global and regional forecast models are run in different countries worldwide, using current weather observations relayed from radiosondes, weather satellites and other observing systems as inputs.	198
ame physical principles can be used to generate either short-term weather forecasts or longer-term climate predictions; the latter are widely applied for understanding and projecting climate change.	198
ant improvements in tropical cyclone track and air quality forecasts; however, atmospheric models perform poorly at handling processes that occur in a relatively constricted area, such as wildfires.	198
Manipulating the vast datasets and performing the complex calculations necessary to modern numerical weather prediction requires some of the most powerful supercomputers in the world.	183
Even with the increasing power of supercomputers, the forecast skill of numerical weather models extends to only about six days.	128
Factors affecting the accuracy of numerical predictions include the density and quality of observations used as input to the forecasts, along with deficiencies in the numerical models themselves.	195
Post-processing techniques such as model output statistics have been developed to improve the handling of errors in numerical predictions.	138
A more fundamental problem lies in the chaotic nature of the partial differential equations that govern the atmosphere.	119
The Social Democratic Party was a social democratic political party in Serbia.	78
In the same year, the SDP joined the DOS governing coalition.	61
A year later the SDP withdrew its support of the government resulting in its fall and an early election.	104
Slobodan Lalović became the Minister of Labour, Employment and Social Policy in the minority government of Vojislav Koštunica.	126
In August two thousand, five the SDP refused to support the proposed pension and oil industry laws.	99
As a result two of its deputies stopped supporting the government.	66
Ljilja Nestorović and Meho Omerović went into opposition, while the third, Slobodan Lalović kept his post, subsequently withdrawing from the party and becoming an independent deputy.	182
In two thousand, four the Democratic Alternative , led by Nebojša Čović, merged into the SDP and assumed leadership over the party.	131
Solar chemical refers to a number of possible processes that harness solar energy by absorbing sunlight in a chemical reaction.	127
r to photosynthesis in plants, which converts solar energy into the chemical bonds of glucose molecules, but without using living organisms, which is why it is also called artificial photosynthesis.	198
A promising approach is to use focused sunlight to provide the energy needed to split water into its constituent hydrogen and oxygen in the presence of a metallic catalyst such as zinc.	185
This is normally done in a two-step process so that hydrogen and oxygen are not produced in the same chamber, which creates an explosion hazard.	144
Another approach involves taking the hydrogen created in this process and combining it with carbon dioxide to create methane.	125
The benefit of this approach is that there is an established infrastructure for transporting and burning methane for power generation, which is not true for hydrogen.	166
f these approaches is common to most methods of energy storage: adding an extra step between energy collection and electricity production drastically decreases the efficiency of the overall process.	198
It is also possible to use solar light to directly drive industrial chemical reactions and applications, eliminating the need to burn fossil fuels for energy.	158
As early as 1909, the dimerization of anthracene into dianthracene was investigated as a means of storing solar energy, as well as the photodimerization of the naphthalene series.	179
In the 70’s and 80’s a fuel had been made from another reversible chemical, the norbornadiene to quadricyclane transformation cycle, but this failed because the reversal process had a low potential.	198
Ruthenium-based molecules were also attempted, but this was dismissed because ruthenium is both rare and too heavy of a material.	129
Henryk Hoser is a Polish prelate of the Catholic Church.	56
On May 24, 2008, Pope Benedict XVI appointed him to head Roman Catholic Diocese of Warszawa-Praga.	98
He is a member of the Presidium of the Polish Episcopal Conference and heads the Team of Experts on Bioethics.	110
Bishop Hoser is a staunch opponent of in vitro fertilisation.	61
On eleven February 2017, Pope Francis named Bishop Hoser his special envoy to Medjugorje, tasked with assessing the pastoral needs of that place of pilgrimage.	159
He was explicitly tasked by the Pope to assess the pastoral situation and not the doctrinal situation which was done by Cardinal Ruini.	135
However he made it clear that he thought very highly of the Medjugorje phenomenon.	82
erred to as partial colour blindness, is an inherited condition in which people have full trichromatic colour vision, but do not make the same colour matches as the majority of the human population.	198
It is much more common than dichromacy or other forms of colour blindness, affecting about six of human males in Northern European populations.	143
Two forms are common, known as protanomaly and deuteranomaly.	61
n order to match a given spectral yellow light, protanomalous observers need more red light in a redgreen anomalies, but with appropriate choices of colours to mix, tritanomaly can also be measured.	198

Uintatherium is an extinct genus of herbivorous mammal that lived during the Eocene epoch.	90
insperatus of Middle to Late Eocene China.	42
Uintatherium was a large browsing animal.	41
70 m , and a weight up to two tonnes, it was similar to today's rhinoceros, both in size and in shape, although they are not closely related.	141
Its legs were robust to sustain the weight of the animal and were equipped with claws.	86
Moreover, a Uintathere's sternum was made up of horizontal segments, unlike today's rhinos, which have compressed vertical segments.	132
he skull, which is both large and strongly built, but simultaneously flat and concave: this feature is rare and, apart from some brontotheres, not regularly characteristic of any other known mammal.	198
Its cranial cavity was exceptionally small due the walls of the cranium being exceedingly thick.	96
The weight of the skull was mitigated by numerous sinuses permeating the walls of the cranium, like those in an elephant's skull.	129
The large upper canine teeth might have served as formidable defensive weapons, and superficially resembled those of saber-toothed cats.	136
r Canyon is a large canyon formed by the Snake River in the Magic Valley region of southern Idaho, forming part of the boundary between Twin Falls County to the south and Jerome County to the north.	198
25 miles wide, and runs for just over fifty miles.	50
Perrine Bridge crosses the canyon immediately north of the city of Twin Falls.	78
Shoshone Falls is located approximately five miles east of Perrine Bridge along the canyon.	91
Perrine and others founded the Magic Valley's first successful agricultural operations on the Snake River Canyon floor.	119
The canyon's value as a farming area diminished after irrigation projects made agriculture practical in the surrounding areas in the early 20th Century.	152
Today the canyon floor is a tourist attraction and features several parks and golf courses.	91
In the past it was generally believed the Snake River Canyon was created by a cataclysmic flood caused by water released from Lake Bonneville approximately 15,000 years ago.	173
However, as of 2000, geologists believe that while the canyon was shaped by the flood, its basic structure predated it.	119
The canyon is well known as the site of an unsuccessful nineteen seventy four attempt by Evel Knievel to jump across it in the Skycycle X-2 rocket.	147

It is the longest highway in Nepal and was constructed by CPWD/PWD Nepali and Indian engineers.	95
The highway is mostly a single lane in each direction.	54
is a major infrastructure element because east-west travel was previously limited to the Hulaki Highway built during the Rana regime, expensive and limited air travel, or Nepalese trains and buses.	197
The major destinations along and around the highway are Mechinagar, Bhadrapur, Itahari, Janakpur, Bharatpur, Butwal, Siddharthanagar, Nepalganj, and Bhim Dutta.	160

The energy value of coal, or the fuel content, is the amount of potential energy in coal that can be converted into actual heating ability.	139
The value can be calculated and compared with different grades of coal or even other materials.	95
Materials of different grades will produce differing amounts of heat for a given mass.	86
While chemistry provides methods of calculating the heating value of a certain amount of a substance, there is a difference between this theoretical value and its application to real coal.	188
Chemical composition of the coal is defined in terms of its proximate and ultimate analyses.	92
The parameters of proximate analysis are moisture, volatile matter, ash, and fixed carbon.	90
Elemental or ultimate analysis encompasses the quantitative determination of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur and oxygen within the coal.	139

The paper negative process consists of using a negative printed on paper to create the final print of a photograph, as opposed to using a modern negative on a film base of cellulose acetate.	190
The plastic acetate negative enables the printing of a very sharp image intended to be as close a representation of the actual subject as is possible.	150
ative based on paper instead, there is the possibility of creating a more ethereal image, simply by using a paper with a very visible grain, or by drawing on the paper or distressing it in some way.	198
One of the original forms of photography was based on the paper negative process.	81
re", used a negative created on paper treated with silver salts, which was exposed in a camera obscura to create the negative and then contact printed on a similar paper to produce a positive image.	198
Through the years afterwards, however, better and more accurate ways of producing exact replicas of nature were developed, and these processes relegated the paper negative process to obsolescence.	196
The process of the paper negative is still relevant, though, in the realm of alternative-process photography.	109
raphers employing alternative processes reject the idea of the exact replica of nature and seek to use the inherent inexactness of antiquated processes to create a more personal and emotional image.	198
The paper negative is an extremely versatile process that allows all manner of reworking and retouching of an image, and is the perfect medium to bridge the gap between camera operator and artist.	196
induction is a basic law of electromagnetism predicting how a magnetic field will interact with an electric circuit to produce an electromotive force —a phenomenon called electromagnetic induction.	197
It is the fundamental operating principle of transformers, inductors, and many types of electrical motors, generators and solenoids.	132
always accompanies a time-varying magnetic field, while Faraday's law states that there is EMF on the conductive loop when the magnetic flux through the surface enclosed by the loop varies in time.	197
Historically, Faraday's law had been discovered and one aspect of it was formulated as the Maxwell–Faraday equation later.	122
Faraday was the first to publish the results of his experiments.	64
iscovered properties of electromagnets, he expected that when current started to flow in one wire, a sort of wave would travel through the ring and cause some electrical effect on the opposite side.	198
He plugged one wire into a galvanometer, and watched it as he connected the other wire to a battery.	100
Indeed, he saw a transient current when he connected the wire to the battery, and another when he disconnected it.	114

It is located in the John Adams Courthouse at Pemberton Square in Boston, Massachusetts, the same building which houses the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and the Massachusetts Appeals Court.	197
The history of the library is very much bound up in the history of the Supreme Judicial Court itself.	101
the Federalists, who wanted to see the common law received into the newly formed United States, and the Jeffersonians, who preferred to have a civil law-based system similar to the Napoleonic Code.	197
The Federalists, who were prominent in Boston and integral to the library's founding, began importing English law books for local lawyers to use.	145
The Supreme Judicial Court, needing a law library for their own use, permitted the library to be moved into the Court's offices in exchange for access to its many volumes.	171
This turn of events allowed the public greater access to the decisions of the courts of Massachusetts, and in turn popularized the common law legal system in the United States.	176

d without any operations that might change when extending the field F , notably without factoring polynomials, this shows that whether two matrices are similar does not change upon field extensions.	198
The form is named after German mathematician Ferdinand Georg Frobenius.	71
Some authors use the term rational canonical form for a somewhat different form that is more properly called the primary rational canonical form.	145
Instead of decomposing into a minimal number of cyclic subspaces, the primary form decomposes into a maximal number of cyclic subspaces.	136
This article mainly deals with the form that does not require factorization, and explicitly mentions "primary" when the form using factorization is meant.	154
and B are similar, one approach is to try, for each of them, to decompose the vector space as far as possible a direct sum of stable subspaces, and compare the respective actions on these subspaces.	198
For instance if both are diagonalizable, then one can take the decomposition into eigenspaces , and then similarity can be decided by comparing eigenvalues and their multiplicities.	181
While in practice this is often a quite insightful approach, there are various drawbacks this has as a general method.	118
First, it requires finding all eigenvalues, say as roots of the characteristic polynomial, but it may not be possible to give an explicit expression for them.	158

Buccal pumping is "breathing with one's cheeks": a method of ventilation used in respiration in which the animal moves the floor of its mouth in a rhythmic manner that is externally apparent.	191
It is the sole means of inflating the lungs in amphibians.	58
There are two methods of buccal pumping, defined by the number of movements of the floor of the mouth needed to complete both inspiration and expiration.	153
Four-stroke buccal pumping is used by some basal ray-finned fish and aquatic amphibians such as Xenopus and Amphiuma.	117
This method has several stages.	31
These will be described for an animal starting with lungs in a deflated state: First, the glottis is closed, and the nostrils are opened.	137
The floor of the mouth is then depressed , drawing air in.	58
The nostrils are then closed, the glottis opened, and the floor of mouth raised, forcing the air into the lungs for gas exchange.	129
To deflate the lungs, the process is reversed.	46
Two-stroke buccal pumping completes the process more quickly, as is seen in most extant amphibians.	99

In mathematics, the L-functions of number theory are expected to have several characteristic properties, one of which is that they satisfy certain functional equations.	168
There is an elaborate theory of what these equations should be, much of which is still conjectural.	99
In every case this relates to some value ζ that is only defined by analytic continuation from the infinite series definition.	125
Therefore, use of the functional equation is basic, in order to study the zeta-function in the whole complex plane.	115

Water treatment is any process that improves the quality of water to make it more acceptable for a specific end-use.	116
The end use may be drinking, industrial water supply, irrigation, river flow maintenance, water recreation or many other uses, including being safely returned to the environment.	178
Water treatment removes contaminants and undesirable components, or reduces their concentration so that the water becomes fit for its desired end-use.	150
Early water treatment methods still used included sand filtration and chlorination.	83
of sand filters to purify the water supply dates to 1804, when the owner of a bleachery in Paisley, Scotland, John Gibb, installed an experimental filter, selling his unwanted surplus to the public.	198
water production involves the removal of contaminants from raw water to produce water that is pure enough for human consumption without any short term or long term risk of any adverse health effect.	198
Substances that are removed during the process of drinking water treatment include suspended solids, bacteria, algae, viruses, fungi, and minerals such as iron and manganese.	174

If there are two or more orientations that can be generated during a reaction, one of them is dominant Regioselectivity can also be applied to specific reactions such as addition to pi ligands.	193
Selectivity also occurs in carbene insertions, for example in the Baeyer-Villiger reaction.	91

Despite being neutral they are able to form stable complexes with high oxidation state metals, such as rare earths, due to the chelate effect.	142
The ligands have been investigated for molecular recognition and their complexes are used in asymmetric catalysts and polymerisation.	133
Trisoxazolines can either be synthesised directly, from suitable tripodal starting materials, or built up in a modular manner.	126
ral ligands with C3 rotational symmetry and the modular approach typically being used to give asymmetric compounds , which are either heterochiral or possess a mix of both chiral and achiral groups.	198
s in symmetry can significantly effect the coordination chemistry of the ligands and the catalytic activity of their complexes, with C3 symmetric ligands often being better for asymmetric catalysis.	198
Suitable tripodal compounds, such as trimesic acid and nitrilotriacetic acid, can be converted directly to trisoxazolines.	122
The simplicity of this approach is beneficial, however it only allows a limited variety of structures to be produced, due to the limited range of available starting materials.	175
Modular synthesis allows for a more diverse range of structures, however the multi-step reactions can result in lower overall yields.	133
