"Gimme," said Aunt Dahlia listlessly.
"Glinda might," he suggested.

"How still and peaceful everything is," said Angela.
"Hullo, eyesore," she said.
"I always thought you were such friends," said Angela.
"I beg your pardon, sir," he said.
"I couldn't say," he replied, beginning to sidle round the bench.
"I feel wise, indeed," he answered, earnestly.
"I hate publicity," said Ricardo acidly.
"I have always liked you as you were," said Dorothy, simply.
"I have come for my brains," remarked the Scarecrow, a little uneasily.
"I have come for my courage," announced the Lion, entering the room.
"I say, Bertie," she said, meditatively chewing fruit salad.
"I see," I said, though I didn't, being still fogged.
"I see," he said, at length.
"I shall be glad to have your company," said Dorothy.
"I think I know what's on your mind, Tuppy," I said.
"I thought you might have been a trifle peeved," I said.
"I want you to fly with me to Kansas," said Dorothy.
"I wish I could," she murmured.
"I've got it," I said.
"If you were to go to her;" He shook his head.
"Impossible," she repeated.
"It is kind of you to like a Scarecrow," he replied.
"It seems gloomy," said the Scarecrow.
"It shall wait here," said Ricardo.
"It's all right," I said.
"Jeeves," I said, "I had not expected this of you."
"Jeeves," I said, "a word with you."

"Just run through that wheeze again, Jeeves," I said thoughtfully.
"Lovely evening," I said.
"Lovely," I agreed.
"Not to you," said Gussie.
"Nothing," I said.
"O Lord," said the young man.
"Oh, hullo, Tuppy," I said, "I wanted to see you."
"Oh, look," she said.
"Oh, no;" answered the Woodman.
"Oh, right ho," I said hastily.
"Oh, yes; sit down in that chair, please," replied Oz.
"Oh, you'll be all right," I said.
"Perhaps there are wild beasts in the forest now," said Dorothy.
"Quite," I replied guardedly.
"Quite," I said, a little hurriedly.
"Right ho," I said.
"She must be softened up," I said.
"She should have come by the omnibus," he repeated and repeated stupidly.
"Shove it down, Aunt Dahlia," I said sympathetically.
"Silly young geezer," I said.
"So the name was Adele," he whispered.
"Tails up be dashed," was her sombre response.
"Tails up, Aunt Dahlia," I urged buoyantly.
"Temporarily, yes," I had to admit.
"Thank you," he answered.
"That is proof that he is sharp," remarked the Lion.
"That is true," agreed the Woodman.
"That must be a matter of opinion," said the Tin Woodman.
"That very sleeve," he said, pointing.
"That would make me very unhappy," answered the china princess.
"That's all right," said the Scarecrow.
"That's so cliche" she said.
"The Silver Shoes," said the Good Witch, "have wonderful powers".
"Then do it," he said with a smug grin.
"There is something cold there," said Tuppy, with growing cheerfulness.
"True," answered Oz.
"Very good," I said coldly.
"Very well," answered Oz, meekly.
"Very well," answered the little man.
"Well, Bertie, dear," she said, "here we all are."
"Well, Gussie," I said.
"Well, I'm glad you're feeling braced," I said.
"Well, Jeeves," I said, "it was certainly one of those afternoons."
"Well, if you say so," said Gussie doubtfully.
"What is the matter?" said Mr. Ricardo superbly.
"With pleasure," she answered, and brought a towel at once.
"Yes," she said, nodding thoughtfully, "you're quite right."
"Yonder, among the oak trees," said the tiger, pointing with his fore-foot.
"You have plenty of courage, I am sure," answered Oz.

'Let me in, blast you!' responded Tuppy's voice from without.
'My darling,' he will say tenderly, 'is there anything I can do?'
'Then, for a beginner,' I said, 'you do it dashed well.'
'Was Tuppy after you?' I asked sympathetically.
'Well, why not?' said Aunt Dahlia.
'What's he doing here?' asked Gussie suspiciously.
'Why, yes, Tom, darling,' you will reply.

Yes, it was a man who asked, a stranger.

You used to joyride like the very devil.
You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt.
You were destroying my life.
You were engaged.

You're in love with some other bloke?
You're in room fifteen J, said the receptionist coldly.
You're joking me, sir, the other managed to articulate.
You're not the chump I took you for, Bertie.
You're positive it's what you're looking for?
You're still sticking to that?
You've heard of this business of mine, I suppose?
You, you would not keep the truth from me.
Young children often like to eat fish fingers, chips and baked beans
Young people are frequently told nowadays to reach for the stars.
Your being wrecked here has been a godsend to me.

You’d be nowhere.
You’d better think about catching your train.
You’ll be catching a crab directly.
You’ll never guess! I couldn’t.
You’re a serpent; and there’s no use denying it.
You’re going to need two tablespoonsful.
Zilla relaxed her sour mouth long enough to sigh her satisfaction.
Zucchini is the same thing as courgette
and they described you jolly well, down to your boots and shirt.
‘A cat may look at a king,’ said Alice.
‘A fine day, your Majesty!’ the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.
‘A quarter to two,’ he said, looking at the parlour clock.
‘Ah, what is it, now?’ the Unicorn cried eagerly.
‘Ahem!’ said the Mouse with an important air, ‘are you all ready?’
‘And how did you manage on the twelfth?’ Alice went on eagerly.
‘And washing?’ said the Mock Turtle.
‘Anything you like,’ said the Footman, and began whistling.
‘Are their heads off?’ shouted the Queen.
‘Are there many crabs here?’ said Alice.
‘Are you animal—vegetable—or mineral?’ he said, yawning at every other word.
‘Blew—me—up,’ panted the Queen, who was still a little out of breath.
‘But I’m not a serpent, I tell you!’ said Alice.
‘But I’m not used to it!’ pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone.
‘But about his toes?’ the Mock Turtle persisted.
‘But she must have a prize herself, you know,’ said the Mouse.
‘Call it what you like,’ said the Cat.
‘Call the next witness!’ said the King.
‘Certainly not!’ said Alice indignantly.
‘Change lobsters again!’ it yelled at the top of its voice.
‘Collar that Dormouse,’ the Queen shrieked out.
‘Come, let’s try the first figure!’ said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon.
‘Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!’ thought Alice.
‘Consider your verdict,’ he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.
‘Did you say pig, or fig?’ said the Cat.
‘Did you say “What a pity!”?’ the Rabbit asked.
‘Digging for apples, indeed!’ said the Rabbit angrily.
‘Does the boots and shoes!’ she repeated in a wondering tone.
‘Each with a lobster as a partner!’ it cried.
‘Exactly so,’ said Alice.
‘Faster!’ and dragged her along.
‘Feather!’ cried the Sheep, as she took up another pair of needles.
‘Fifteenth,’ said the March Hare.
‘Fivepence farthing for one—Twopence for two,’ the Sheep replied.
‘Fourteenth of March, I think it was,’ he said.
‘Give your evidence,’ said the King.
‘Good-bye, till we meet again!’ she said as cheerfully as she could.
‘Hand it over here,’ said the Dodo.
‘Have some wine,’ the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.
‘He must have imitated somebody else’s hand,’ said the King.
‘Herald, read the accusation!’ said the King.
‘Hold your tongue!’ it added, before Alice could speak again.
‘How am I to get in?’ asked Alice again, in a louder tone.
‘How can I have done that?’ she thought.
‘How can she knit with so many?’ the puzzled child thought to herself.
‘How do you know I’m mad?’ said Alice.
‘How dreadfully savage!’ exclaimed Alice.
‘How should I know?’ said Alice, surprised at her own courage.
‘I am so sleepy?’ she moaned.
‘I beg your pardon?’ said Alice.
‘I call it purring, not growling,’ said Alice.
‘I don’t know what you mean,’ she said.
‘I don’t know,’ Alice said doubtfully.
‘I don’t much care where—’ said Alice.
‘I don’t see any wine,’ she remarked.
‘I like birthday presents best,’ she said at last.
‘I mean what I say,’ the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone.
‘I never bet half a dozen!’ said the other.
‘I never saw one, or heard of one,’ said Alice.
‘I only wish I had such eyes,’ the King remarked in a fretful tone.
‘I see somebody now!’ she exclaimed at last.
‘I should like to hear her try and repeat something now.
‘I should win easy,’ said the Lion.
‘I talk English, don’t I?’ the Frog went on.
‘I thought it would,’ said the Cat, and vanished again.
‘I thought you did,’ said the Mouse.
‘I wish I knew!’ thought poor Alice.
‘I wonder how many miles I’ve fallen by this time?’ she said aloud.
‘If I’d meant that, I’d have said it,’ said Humpty Dumpty.
‘It all came different!’ the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully.
‘It always happens,’ said the gnat.
‘It began with blotting paper,’ the Knight answered with a groan.
‘It can’t be anybody else!’ she said to herself.
‘It does the boots and shoes,’ it replied very solemnly.
‘It gets easier further on,’ Humpty Dumpty replied.
‘It is striking four,’ I answered.
‘It is well you are out of my reach,’ he exclaimed.
‘It isn’t mine,’ said the Hatter.
‘It isn’t respectable to beg,’ said the King.
‘It must be a very pretty dance,’ said Alice timidly.
‘It proves nothing of the sort!’ said Alice.
‘It was the best butter,’ the March Hare meekly replied.
‘It’s a fabulous monster!’ the Unicorn cried out, before Alice could reply.
‘It’s exactly like a riddle with no answer!’ she thought.
‘It’s really dreadful,’ she muttered to herself, ‘the way all the creatures argue’.
‘It’s—it’s a very fine day!’ said a timid voice at her side.
‘I’d rather see that done on paper,’ he said.
‘I’ll fetch the executioner myself,’ said the King eagerly, and he hurried off.
‘I’m a poor man, your Majesty,’ he began.
‘I’m not a mile high,’ said Alice.
‘I’m not a serpent!’ said Alice indignantly.
‘I’m not a visitor, and I’m not a servant.
‘I’m not offended,’ said Humpty Dumpty.
‘I’m not so sure of that,’ said the Unicorn.
‘I’ve got it!’ she cried in a triumphant tone.
‘Keep your temper,’ said the Caterpillar.
‘Leave off that!’ screamed the Queen.
‘Look, look!’ she cried, pointing eagerly.
‘Must a name mean something?’ Alice asked doubtfully.
‘Nearly there!’ the Queen repeated.
‘Nearly two miles high,’ added the Queen.
‘Never mind!’ said the King, with an air of great relief.
‘Never!’ said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard as she spoke.
‘No, Mr. Lockwood,’ said Nelly, shaking her head.
‘No, no!’ said the Queen.
‘No,’ said the Caterpillar.
‘Nobody,’ said the messenger.
‘Nonsense!’ said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was silent.
‘Not at all,’ gruffly remarked the elder man.
‘Not yet, not yet!’ the Rabbit hastily interrupted.
‘Not yet,’ said the Knight.
‘Nothing!’ Alice said impatiently.
‘Now, Kitty!’ she cried, clapping her hands triumphantly.
‘Of course twinkling begins with a T!’ said the King sharply.
‘Of course,’ the Dodo replied very gravely.
‘Off with her head!’ the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.
‘Oh, don’t talk about trouble!’ said the Duchess.
‘Oh, hush!’ the Rabbit whispered in a frightened tone.
‘Oh, no, Sir,’ replied Mary eagerly.
‘Oh, you can’t help that,’ said the Cat: ‘we’re all mad here’.
‘Oh, you foolish Alice!’ she answered herself.
‘Oh, you sing,’ it said.
‘One, indeed!’ said the Dormouse indignantly.
‘Only a thimble,’ said Alice sadly.
‘Open the bag!’ he whispered.
‘Sap and sawdust,’ said the gnat.
‘Serpent!’ screamed the Pigeon.
‘Seven years and six months!’ Humpty Dumpty repeated thoughtfully.
‘She boxed the Queen’s ears—’ the Rabbit began.
‘She can’t do addition,’ the Red Queen interrupted.
‘She can’t explain it,’ it said hastily.
‘She’s coming!’ cried the Larkspur.
‘She’s grown a good deal!’ was her first remark.
‘She’s my prisoner, you know!’ the Red Knight said at last.
‘She’s tired, poor thing!’ said the Red Queen.
‘Sixteenth,’ added the Dormouse.
‘So much obliged!’ added Tweedledee.
‘Speak when you’re spoken to!’ The Queen sharply interrupted her.
‘Speak, can’t you?’ he cried impatiently.
‘Stand up and repeat “‘Tis the voice of the sluggard,”’ it said.
‘Suppose we change the subject,’ the March Hare interrupted, yawning.
‘Swim after them!’ it screamed.
‘Take off your hat,’ the King said to the Hatter.
‘Thank you,’ said Alice, ‘it’s very interesting’.
‘That proves his guilt,’ said the Queen.
‘That’s just what I complain of,’ said Humpty Dumpty.
‘That’s none of your business, Two!’ said Seven.
‘That’s right!’ said the Tiger-lily.
‘That’s right!’ shouted the Queen.
‘That’s very curious!’ she thought.
‘The daisies are worst of all.
‘Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!’ the soldiers shouted in reply.
‘Then if the dog went away, its temper would remain!’ the Queen exclaimed triumphantly.
‘Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,’ said the Cat.
‘Then it wasn’t very civil of you to offer it,’ said Alice angrily.
‘Then the Dormouse shall!’ they both cried.
‘There’s nothing but hay left now,’ the Messenger said, peeping into the bag.
‘They are going to the Grange, then?’ I said.
‘They lived on treacle,’ said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or two.
‘Thinking again?’ the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp little chin.
‘Three hundred and sixty-five,’ said Alice.
‘Tickets, please!’ said the Guard, putting his head in at the window.
‘To answer the door?’ he said.
‘To guard against the bites of sharks,’ the Knight replied.
‘Treacle,’ said a sleepy voice behind her.
‘Treacle,’ said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.
‘Turn a somersault in the sea!’ cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly about.
‘Very much indeed,’ said Alice.
‘Very true,’ said the Duchess: ‘flamingoes and mustard both bite’.
‘Very,’ said Alice: ‘—where’s the Duchess?’
‘Wake up, Dormouse!’ And they pinched it on both sides at once.
‘We wanted to plant some flowers there,’ she cried.
‘Well, only on Thursdays,’ said the Queen.
‘What a funny watch!’ she remarked.
‘What a number of cucumber-frames there must be!’ thought Alice.
‘What a thick black cloud that is!’ she said.
‘What are they doing?’ Alice whispered.
‘What can all that green stuff be?’ said Alice.
‘What do you call yourself?’ the Fawn said at last.
‘What else have you got in your pocket?’ he went on, turning to Alice.
‘What fun!’ it said, half to itself, half to Alice.
‘What impertinence!’ said the pudding.
‘What is it, now?’ the Frog said in a deep hoarse whisper.
‘What is the fun?’ said Alice.
‘What size do you want to be?’ it asked.
‘What sort of things do you remember best?’ Alice ventured to ask.
‘What was that?’ inquired Alice.
‘What’s that you say?’ - pretending that the kitten was speaking.
‘Where do you come from?’ said the Red Queen.
‘Where shall I begin, please your Majesty?’ he asked.
‘Which door?’ said the Frog.
‘Who are you?’ said the Caterpillar.
‘Who’s making personal remarks now?’ the Hatter asked triumphantly.
‘Why the Lion and the Unicorn, of course,’ said the King.
‘Why, because there’s nobody with me!’ cried Humpty Dumpty.
‘Why, she,’ it said.
‘Would you like to see a little of it?’ said the Mock Turtle.
‘Yes!’ shouted Alice.
‘Yes, please do!’ pleaded Alice.
‘Yes, pretty well—some poetry,’ Alice said doubtfully.
‘Yes,’ said Alice, ‘we learned French and music.’
‘You did,’ said the Mock Turtle.
‘You’d better not talk!’ said Five.
‘You’re a very poor speaker,’ said the King.
‘You’re holding it upside down!’ Alice interrupted.
‘You’re thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk.
‘You’ve been wrong!’ cried Tweedledum.
‘You’ve missed the soup and fish,’ she said.
“A bet,” I said.
“A ripping speech,” he said.
“And that’s all I get,” he moaned.
“At your service,” he said politely.
“Bob’s got to go to town tonight,” he added, turning to me.
“But I’m a strong teetotaller,” he said pugnaciously.
“How Nellie will chuckle,” said the plump man.
“I am afraid he must put off his journey,” I said.
“I want a word with you.” And I led him into the dining-room.
“I want to write books,” he said.
“Look at the time,” said the old man.
“Mining engineer,” I said.
“Mr Scudder...” I stammered.
“Oh, damn,” said the young man.
“Pardon,” he said, “I’m a bit rattled tonight”.
“Stop that row, Paddock,” I said.
“That’s what comes of being a teetotaller,” he observed in bitter regret.
“The boy’s uncle is down there,” said Jip quietly.
“There’s two chaps below looking for you,” he whispered.
“Was it as bad as that?” he asked ruefully.
“Where did you find out this story?” I asked.
“Yes and no,” he said.
“Your paper woke them up,” he said gleefully.
“You’re the right sort of fellow,” he said.
“You’re young to be an innkeeper,” I said.

In horology, a tourbillon is an addition to the mechanics of a watch escapement.
tourbillon aims to counter the effects of gravity by mounting the escapement and balance wheel in a rotating cage, to negate the effect of gravity when the timepiece is stuck in a certain position.
By continuously rotating the entire balance wheel/escapement assembly at a slow rate , the tourbillon averages out positional errors.
Originally an attempt to improve accuracy, tourbillons are still included in some expensive modern watches as a novelty and demonstration of watchmaking virtuosity.
The mechanism is usually exposed on the watch's face to show it off.
Gravity directly affects the most delicate parts of the escapement, namely the pallet fork, balance wheel and hairspring.
thus the part most sensitive to exterior effects, such as magnetism, shocks, temperature, as well as inner effects such as pinning positions , terminal curve, and heavy points on the balance wheel.
Many inventions have been developed to counteract these problems.
Temperature and magnetism problems have been eliminated with new materials.
Shocks have much less effect today than at Breguet's time thanks to stronger and more resilient materials.

Planning permission for this project was refused in August 2012, as Aberdeen City Council opted to examine other possibilities for development in the area.

Cove Rangers left Allan Park in April 2015, having sold the ground to a housing developer.
The club reached agreements to ground-share with four other clubs during the 2015–16 season.
The plans included a stand with 312 seats, an "all-weather" 3G pitch and 110 car parking spaces.
A sponsorship deal with the Aberdeen-based Balmoral Group in December 2016 included naming rights for the Calder Park ground, which will be known as the Balmoral Stadium.

the relations between the NAS and the parties soon deteriorated to the point that in 1896 both the Socialist League and the SDAP were expelled from the NAS, leaving only unions in the organization.
All unions in the federation had one vote, no matter what their size, but financial contributions to the union funds were on a per capita basis.
er, the NAS supported in principle all strikes - be they by NAS members or by non-affiliated unions or even individuals, because all strikes were seen as a learning experience for the working class.
The financial shortage that resulted from this as well as increasing anarchist tendencies in the NAS soon led many of the larger unions to leave the organization.
1903 saw relations between the NAS on the one hand and the SDAP and many of the large non-NAS unions deteriorate further.
A successful general strike which started in January 1903 led to strict laws prohibiting such strikes.
A "Resistance Committee" consisting of the NAS, the SDAP, and the General Diamond Workers' Union of the Netherlands , the largest non-NAS union in the country, soon fell apart.

Today, the population is predominantly Muslim, with small Christian and Samaritan minorities.
The city was named by the Roman Emperor Vespasian in 72 CE as Flavia Neapolis.
ristian and Samaritan inhabitants climaxed in a series of Samaritan revolts against Byzantine rule, before their violent quelling in 529 CE drastically dwindled that community's numbers in the city.
In 636, in the early Muslim period, Neapolis, along with most of Palestine, came under the rule of the Islamic Arab Caliphate of Umar ibn al-Khattab; its name Arabicized to Nablus.
In 1099, the Crusaders took control of the city for less than a century, leaving its mixed Muslim, Christian and Samaritan population relatively undisturbed.
This was followed by the Ayyubid and Mamluk periods.
After Saladin's Ayyubid forces took control of the interior of Palestine in 1187, Islamic rule was reestablished, and continued under the Mamluk and Ottoman empires to follow.
Following its incorporation into the Ottoman Empire in 1517, Nablus was designated capital of the Jabal Nablus district.

Bone fracture, which is a complete or partial break in the bone, is a very common condition that has more than three million US cases per year.

Schumacher is a lunar impact crater that lies in the northeast part of the Moon, just to the north of the larger walled plain Messala.
The two formations are separated by a rough strip of terrain less than 10 kilometers across, and bisected by a pair of small, co-joined craters.
The northern member of this pair lies across the southern rim of Schumacher, and intrudes into the interior floor.
There is a low terrace along the northwestern inner wall.
The rim is also notched along the eastern side by a pair of outward bulges.
The interior floor of this crater has been resurfaced by basaltic lava, and now forms a level, nearly featureless plain.
The floor is somewhat darker in the western half, which the albedo in the eastern half matches the surrounding lunar terrain.
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Schumacher.
Depending on the culture, all members of a family unit may have identical surnames or there may be variations based on the cultural rules.
In the English-speaking world, a surname is commonly referred to as a last name because it is usually placed at the end of a person's full name, after any given names.
In many parts of Asia, as well as some parts of Europe and Africa, the family name is placed before a person's given name.
Surnames have not always existed and today are not universal in all cultures.
This tradition has arisen separately in different cultures around the world.
In Europe, the concept of surnames became popular in the Roman Empire and expanded throughout the Mediterranean and Western Europe as a result.
During the Middle Ages this practice died out as Germanic, Persian, and other influences took hold.
During the late Middle Ages surnames gradually re-emerged, first in the form of bynames , which gradually evolved into modern surnames.

Before release AGA was codenamed Pandora by Commodore International.
AGA was originally called AA for Advanced Architecture in the United States.
The name was later changed to AGA for the European market to reflect that it largely improved the graphical subsystem, and to avoid trademark issues.
AGA is able to display graphics modes with a depth of up to 8 bits per pixel.
This allows for 256 colors in indexed display modes and 262,144 colors in Hold-And-Modify modes.
Other features added to AGA over ECS were super-hi-res smooth scrolling and 32-bit fast page memory fetches to supply the graphics data bandwidth for 8 bitplane graphics modes and wider sprites.
de of the other chipset that Commodore had begun in 1988, the Amiga Advanced Architecture chipset , lacking many features that would have made it competitive with other graphic chipsets of its time.
Apart from the graphics data fetches, AGA still operates on 16-bit data only, meaning that a lot of bandwidth is wasted during register accesses and Amiga 'copper' and blitter operations.
Also the lack of a chunky graphics mode is a speed impediment to graphics operations not tailored for planar modes, resulting in ghost artifacts during the common productivity task of scrolling.

A rest is an interval of silence in a piece of music, marked by a symbol indicating the length of the pause.
Each rest symbol and name corresponds with a particular note value for length, indicating how long the silence should last.
Rests are intervals of silence in pieces of music, marked by symbols indicating the length of the pause.
Each rest symbol and name corresponds with a particular note value, indicating how long the silence should last, generally as a multiplier of a measure or whole note.
The quarter rest may also be found as a form in older music.
The four-measure rest or longa rest are only used in long silent passages which are not divided into bars.
The combination of rests used to mark a pause follows the same rules as for note values.
When an entire bar is devoid of notes, a whole rest is used, regardless of the actual time signature.
xceptions are for a 42 time signature , when a double whole rest is typically used for a bar's rest, and for time signatures shorter than 316, when a rest of the actual measure length would be used.
For a 42 bar rest, it is also common to use the whole rest instead of the double whole rest, so that a whole-bar rest for all time signatures starting from 316 is notated using a whole note rest.

In zoology, the Principle of Coordination is one of the guiding principles of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature.
It states that the act of publishing a new zoological name thereby automatically and simultaneously establishes all the corresponding names in the relevant other ranks, with the same type.
The same applies to the name of a subspecies; this establishes the corresponding species name.
In the family-group, publication of the name of a family, subfamily, superfamily also establishes the names in all the other ranks in the family group.
Author citations for such names are the same as for the name actually published.
It is immaterial if there is an actual taxon to which the automatically established name applies; if ever such a taxon is recognised, there is a name available for it.

The Large Underground Xenon experiment aims to directly detect weakly interacting massive particle dark matter interactions with ordinary matter on Earth.
Despite the wealth of evidence supporting the existence of non-baryonic dark matter in the Universe, dark matter particles in our galaxy have never been directly detected in an experiment.
utilizes a 370 kg liquid xenon detection mass in a time-projection chamber to identify individual particle interactions, searching for faint dark matter interactions with unprecedented sensitivity.
The LUX experiment, which cost approximately $10 million to build, is located 1,510 m underground at the Sanford Underground Laboratory in the Homestake Mine in Lead, South Dakota.
The detector is located in the Davis campus, former site of the Nobel Prize-winning Homestake neutrino experiment led by Raymond Davis.
It is operated underground to reduce the background noise signal caused by high-energy cosmic rays at the Earth's surface.
The detector is isolated from background particles by a surrounding water tank and the earth above.
This shielding reduces cosmic rays and radiation interacting with the xenon.
Interactions in liquid xenon generate 175 nm ultraviolet photons and electrons.
The photons are immediately detected by two arrays of 61 photomultiplier tubes at the top and bottom of the detector.
These prompt photons are the S1 signal.

el mines are used in a similar manner to anti-tank mines, in static "mine fields" along national borders or in defense of strategic positions as described in greater detail in the land mine article.
What makes them different from most anti-tank mines, however, is their smaller size, which enables large numbers to be simultaneously deployed over a large area.
This process can be done manually, via dispensers on land vehicles, or from helicopters or aircraft.

A chemotherapy regimen is a regimen for chemotherapy, defining the drugs to be used, their dosage, the frequency and duration of treatments, and other considerations.
In modern oncology, many regimens combine several chemotherapy drugs in combination chemotherapy.
The majority of drugs used in cancer chemotherapy are cytostatic, many via cytotoxicity.
y of medical oncology, including combination chemotherapy, is that different drugs work through different mechanisms, and that the results of using multiple drugs will be synergistic to some extent.
Because they have different dose-limiting adverse effects, they can be given together at full doses in chemotherapy regimens.
The first successful combination chemotherapy was MOPP, introduced in 1963 for lymphomas.
The term "induction regimen" refers to a chemotherapy regimen used for the initial treatment of a disease.
A "maintenance regimen" refers to the ongoing use of chemotherapy to reduce the chances of a cancer recurring or to prevent an existing cancer from continuing to grow.
Chemotherapy regimens are often identified by acronyms, identifying the agents used in the drug combination.
However, the letters used are not consistent across regimens, and in some cases - for example, "BEACOPP" - the same letter combination is used to represent two different treatments.
There is no widely accepted naming convention or standard for the nomenclature of chemotherapy regimens.
For example, either generic or brand names may be used for acronyms.
This page merely lists commonly used conventions.

Total metal jacket bullets are made by electroplating a thin jacket of ductile metal over a core of different metal requiring protection from abrasion or corrosion.
Similar full metal jacket bullets mechanically swage a thin sheet of metal over the core.
The swaging process leaves an opening exposing the core on the base of the bullet, while electroplating deposits a jacket over the entire bullet surface.
Protecting the base of a lead-core bullet from burning powder gas may prevent molten lead from being released as a fine spray in turbulent gas leaving the muzzle of a firearm.
Electrolytic deposition can create very thin jackets, while jackets applied by swaging must be thick enough to avoid being torn during the swaging process.
Uniformly electroplated jackets may produce more accurate bullets than jacket and core materials deformed during swaging.
Thinner electroplated jackets may not be as strong as conventional swaged jackets of similar metal, and may not prevent leading at higher bullet velocities.
Thinner jackets may be damaged by and foul barrel ports for gas-operated reloading or recoil compensation.

Wyatt was working as a nurse anesthetist in a hospital in Madison, Tennessee, when in 1960, he saw a picture in Life of the Durupınar site, a boat-like shape on a mountain near Mount Ararat.
The resulting widespread speculation in evangelical Christian circles that this might be Noah's Ark started Wyatt on his career as an amateur archaeologist.
From 1977 until his death in 1999 he made over one hundred trips to the Middle East, his interests widening to take in a wide variety of references from the Old and New Testaments.
By the time of his death in 1999, Wyatt claimed to have discovered several sites and artifacts related to the Bible and Biblical archaeology.

As far as we are aware nothing was ever discovered to support his claims nor have we seen any evidence of biblical artifacts or temple treasures.

Some patients died while they were on the waiting list; reports differ about whether they died because of the delay.

jurisdiction covering one or more counties, which are administrative divisions within a country, not to be confused with the medieval system of county courts held by the high sheriff of each county.
Since 2014, England and Wales have had what is officially described as "a single civil court" named the County Court, with unlimited financial jurisdiction.
However it should be understood that there are County Court buildings and courtrooms throughout England and Wales, not one single location.
It is "a single civil court" in the sense of a single centrally organised and administered court system.
were numerous separate county court systems, each with jurisdiction across England and Wales for enforcement of its orders, but each with a defined "county court district" from which it took claims.
County court districts did not have the same boundaries as counties: the name was used because the county courts had evolved from courts which did in fact correspond to a county's territory.
Today the court sits in many County Court centres, currently corresponding to the old individual county courts.
County Court matters can be lodged at a court in person, by post or via the Internet in some cases through the County Court Bulk Centre.
Cases are normally heard at the court having jurisdiction over the area where the claimant lives.
Most matters are decided by a district judge or circuit judge sitting alone.
Xerotine siccative was an oil drying agent used in the late 19th century.
It is a type of terebene; unlike standard terebenes, xerotine siccative doesn't become cloudy when mixed in an oil.
Replacing boiled oil, xerotine siccative was mixed with paint in order to speed up the drying process; however, its use ceased when it was discovered to be highly flammable.
In November of the same year there was an explosion on the HMS Triumph which killed three men and wounded seven more.
The words "xerotine" and "siccative" each mean "drier" in Greek and Latin respectively.
As an oil dryer, xerotine siccative was mixed with oil based paints in order to speed the drying time of the paint.
The first evidence that xerotine siccative was a chief agent in the explosions of these ships came from an investigation done on Cockatrice.
It was discovered that prior to the explosion, a man entered the ship's storeroom with an open flame, which he held next to an uncorked can of xerotine siccative.
Grenfell reported that xerotine siccative had been supplied to the ship as a harmless substance and as a result, no precautions were taken towards it.
Subsequent inquiries into an explosion aboard Triumph and HMS Doterel revealed that both resulted from explosions due to xerotine siccative.
Baird, carpenter of Doterel, testified that he was supplied with the agent in an earthenware jar.

Around 1706, some Apalachicola moved from the Apalachicola River area to the Savannah River, which formed the future border between the colony of South Carolina and Georgia.
They may have been captured during English-sponsored slave raids and forced to relocate to the Savannah River area.
A census taken in 1708 described the Apalachicola of the Savannah River as the "Naleathuckles", with 80 men settled in a town about 20 miles up the Savannah River.
It described the Savannah River Apalachicola as living in two villages and having a population of 214 people: 64 men, 71 women, 42 boys, and 37 girls.
In the Yamasee War of 1715, the Apalachicola joined in the Native American attacks on South Carolina.
Afterward, the survivors returned to the Apalachicola River, forming near the confluence of the Chattahoochee and Flint rivers.

"She Is Love," sung by Jon Camp, was meant to be sung by Annie Haslam, but the orchestral backing track turned out to have been recorded in the wrong key for her.
This is Jon Camp's version; another version is from an Annie Haslam interview, where she confirmed she was too exhausted to get in to her car and drive to the studio and sing the song.
ime studio technique was advanced enough to transform the backing track to any key that would have suited her — with her three-octave range it would be difficult to find a key that did not suit her.
Drummer Terry Sullivan had his first songwriting credit with the band on the title track.
He was responsible for the basic tune to the song's extended instrumental intro.

ckman correction is any of a number of related statistical methods developed by James Heckman at the University of Chicago from 1976 to 1979 which allow the researcher to correct for selection bias.
n bias problems are endemic to applied econometric problems, which make Heckman’s original technique, and subsequent refinements by both himself and others, indispensable to applied econometricians.
Heckman received the Economics Nobel Prize in 2000 for his work in this field.
Statistical analyses based on non-randomly selected samples can lead to erroneous conclusions.
The Heckman correction, a two-step statistical approach, offers a means of correcting for non-randomly selected samples.
Heckman discussed bias from using nonrandom selected samples to estimate behavioral relationships as a specification error.
He suggests a two-stage estimation method to correct the bias.
The correction uses a control function idea and is easy to implement.
Heckman’s correction involves a normality assumption, provides a test for sample selection bias and formula for bias corrected model.
Suppose that a researcher wants to estimate the determinants of wage offers, but has access to wage observations for only those who work.

In knot theory, a prime knot or prime link is a knot that is, in a certain sense, indecomposable.
Specifically, it is a non-trivial knot which cannot be written as the knot sum of two non-trivial knots.
Knots that are not prime are said to be composite knots or composite links.
It can be a nontrivial problem to determine whether a given knot is prime or not.
A family of examples of prime knots are the torus knots.
These are formed by wrapping a circle around a torus p times in one direction and q times in the other, where p and q are coprime integers.
The simplest prime knot is the trefoil with three crossings.
The trefoil is actually a -torus knot.
The figure-eight knot, with four crossings, is the simplest non-torus knot.
For any positive integer n, there are a finite number of prime knots with n crossings.
was a reform movement in the 14th-, 15th- and 16th-century Catholic Church which held that supreme authority in the Church resided with an Ecumenical council, apart from, or even against, the pope.
The movement emerged in response to the Western Schism between rival popes in Rome and Avignon.
The schism inspired the summoning of the Council of Pisa , which failed to end the schism, and the Council of Constance , which succeeded and proclaimed its own superiority over the Pope.
Conciliarism reached its apex with the Council of Basel , which ultimately fell apart.
The 13th and 14th centuries were a period of challenges to papal authority in Catholic Europe.
These new challenges were marked by disputes between the Papacy and the secular kings of Europe.
In particular the quarrel between Philip IV of France and Pope Boniface VIII over the right to tax the clergy in France was especially heated.
Philip was excommunicated and Boniface was accused of corruption, sorcery, and sodomy.

the mention of a place, and an unambiguous spatial footprint of the same place.
The same geographic names have historically been used by emigrant settlers to denote their new homes, leading to referential ambiguity of place names.
To map a set of place names or toponyms that occur in a document to their corresponding latitude/longitude coordinates, a polygon, or any other spatial footprint, a disambiguation step is necessary.
A toponym resolution algorithm is an automatic method that performs a mapping from a toponym to a spatial footprint.
Most methods for toponym resolution employ a gazetteer of possible mappings between names and spatial footprints.
h are typically stored in structured database records, toponym resolution is typically applied to large unstructured text document collections to associate the locations mentioned in them with maps.
The process of annotating media using spatial footprints is known as Geotagging.

military science, Force multiplication or a force multiplier refers to a factor or a combination of factors that gives personnel or weapons the ability to accomplish greater things than without it.
The expected size increase required to have the same effectiveness without that advantage is the multiplication factor.
For example, if a certain technology like GPS enables a force to accomplish the same results of a force five times as large but without GPS, then the multiplier is five.
Such estimates are used to justify an investment cost for force multipliers.

St Austell is a town in Cornwall, England, 10 miles south of Bodmin and 30 miles west of the border with Devon.
Not long after William Cookworthy discovered china clay at Tregonning Hill in west Cornwall, the same mineral was found in greater quantity in Hensbarrow downs north of St Austell.

bility of the industry attracted many families whose breadwinner had been put out of work by the depression in the local metal mining industry, and increased the population of the town considerably.
This meant that more shops and businesses took root, providing more jobs and improving trade.
This, along with other factors, led to St Austell becoming one of the ten most important commercial centres of Cornwall.

A hot, dust-obscured galaxy, or hot DOG, is a rare type of quasar.
s of radiation which heats the infalling dust and gas, releasing infrared light at a rate about 1,000 times as much as the Milky Way, making these some of the most luminous galaxies in the universe.
However, the density of the surrounding dust is so great that most of that light is obscured.
They also appear to concentrate a much higher proportion of their galactic mass in the central black hole than is observed in normal galaxies.
ere the central black hole is capturing material at a rate faster than new stars are forming, yet the radiation pressure from that rapid absorption is pushing away much of that surrounding material.
The black hole will eventually clear its area of influence of the excessive dust and gas, rendering it a regular, visible galaxy.
These objects were first detected by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer in 2010, and only one out of every 3,000 quasars observed by WISE are of this type.
Wu et al refer to these galaxies as "W1W2-dropouts" because they are faint or invisible in WISE's W1 and W2 detection bands.

There were also many instances stretching back to colonial times where Puritan congregations embraced presbyterian polity.
The Plan of Union was initially agreed upon between the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church and the Connecticut General Association of Congregational Churches.
The Plan was later approved by the Congregational associations in Vermont, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts.
It enabled churches of either denomination to hire ministers from the other.
Congregations were given the choice whether to be governed by congregational polity or by the Presbyterian model of a session of ruling elders.
The Plan also made it possible for the Middle Association of Congregationalists in New York to become a subordinate jurisdiction of the Presbyterian Synod of Albany.
By 1831, the majority of board members and missionaries of the ABCFM were Presbyterians.

h or aquatic amphibians can detect electric fields using specialized electroreceptors to detect and to locate the source of an external electric field in its environment creating the electric field.
nal electric fields can be produced by any bioelectrical process in an organism, especially by actions of the nerves or muscles of fish, or indeed by the specially developed electric organs of fish.
Other fields are induced by movement of a conducting organism through the earth's magnetic field, or from atmospheric electricity.
Electrolocating fish use this ability to detect prey, locate other fish, avoid predators, and navigate by the Earth's magnetic field.
evolved once or twice early in vertebrate evolution, but the sense was apparently lost in amniotes, and in a large number of the Actinopterygii only to reappear independently in two teleost clades.
In fish, the ampullary receptor is a specialized receptor that it uses to sense these electric fields and allows the fish to follow electric field lines to their source.
Sharks primarily use specialized receptors, called Ampullae of Lorenzini, to detect their prey's low frequency DC fields and may also use their receptors in navigation by the Earth's magnetic field.
Weakly electric fish use their ampullary receptors and tuberous receptors to detect the weakly electric fields produced by other fish, as well as for possible predator avoidance.
ion contrasts with active electrolocation, in which the animal emits its own weak self generated electric field and detects nearby objects by detecting the distortion of its produced electric field.
600 species are known to be electroreceptive.

Taepodong-1 was a three-stage technology demonstrator developed by North Korea, a development step toward an intermediate-range ballistic missile.
The missile was derived originally from the Scud rocket and was tested once in 1998 as a space launch vehicle.
On August 31, 1998, North Korea announced that they had used this rocket to launch their first satellite Kwangmyŏngsŏng-1 from a pad on the Musudan-ri peninsula.
However, the satellite failed to achieve orbit; outside observers conjecture that the additional third stage either failed to fire or malfunctioned.
This is contrary to official statements of the North Korean state media, which stated that the satellite achieved orbit about 5 minutes after launch.
On this single launch, the main two-stage booster flew for 1,646 km without any significant problems.

According to post-launch analysis of the launch vehicle, debris from the third stage fell as far as 4,000 kilometers from the launch pad.
Some analysts believe that a three-stage space booster variant of the Taepodong-1 could be capable of travelling as far as 5,900 kilometers with a very small payload.
In 2003 the US Defense Intelligence Agency reported to the Congress: "We have no information to suggest Pyongyang intends to deploy the Taepo Dong 1 as a surface-to-surface missile in North Korea.

Paraformaldehyde is the smallest polyoxymethylene, the polymerization product of formaldehyde with a typical degree of polymerization of 8–100 units.
Paraformaldehyde commonly has a slight odor of formaldehyde due to decomposition.
Paraformaldehyde is a poly-acetal.
Paraformaldehyde forms slowly in aqueous formaldehyde solutions as a white precipitate, especially if stored in the cold.
Formalin actually contains very little monomeric formaldehyde; most of it forms short chains of polyformaldehyde.
A small amount of methanol is often added as a stabilizer to limit the extent of polymerization.
Paraformaldehyde can be depolymerized to formaldehyde gas by dry heating and to formaldehyde solution by water in the presence of a base or heat.
The high purity formaldehyde solutions obtained in this way are used as a fixative for microscopy and histology.
The resulting formaldehyde gas from dry heating paraformaldehyde is flammable.
Once paraformaldehyde is depolymerized, the resulting formaldehyde may be used as a fumigant, disinfectant, fungicide, and fixative.

Diseased tissues are often stiffer than the surrounding normal tissue.
For instance, breast cancers are much harder than healthy fibroglandular tissue.
This characteristic has been used by physicians for screening and diagnosis of many diseases, through palpation.
MRE calculates the mechanical parameter as elicited by palpation, in a non-invasive and objective way.
Magnetic resonance elastography works by using an additional gradient waveform in the pulse sequence to sensitize the MRI scan to shear waves in the tissue.
The shear waves are generated by an electro-mechanical transducer on the surface of the skin.
Both the mechanical excitation and the motion sensitizing gradient are at the same frequency.
This encodes the amplitude of the shear wave in the tissue in the phase of the MRI image.
An algorithm can be used to extract a quantitative measure of tissue stiffness from the MRI in an elastogram.
Magnetic resonance elastography was first introduced by Muthupillai et al.
in 1995 and is being investigated to be used for a multitude of diseases that affect the tissue stiffness.
It has been used clinically for the assessment of liver fibrosis.
etallic resistivity and low Schottky barrier of TbSi2 make it a potential candidate for applications such as infrared detectors, ohmic contacts, magnetoresistive devices, and thermoelectric devices.

Humbermede, often called Emery, is a neighbourhood of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
Humbermede, like many of the "Humber" neighbourhoods in the city, gets its name from the Humber River.
It is bounded on the west by the Humber River, on the north by Finch Avenue West, on the east by the Highway 400 and on the south by Sheppard Avenue West.
A farming hamlet developed by 1870 at the crossroads of Finch Avenue and Weston Road, named Dayton.
A Dayton railway station at Finch Avenue and a Dayton post office were opened around that time.
It was changed to Emery.
One reason suggested for the change was to avoid confusion with Dayton, Ohio.
By 1960, the area started being converted to urban uses, as part of North York.

album is to be a more "upbeat" follow up to their previous album Bears, Mayors, Scraps & Bones, with vocalist Liam Cormier saying the album was lyrically far too dark for what the band wanted to do.
In December 2011, Liam Cormier was asked about whether the groups sound has change much.
"I think sound-wise there's definitely more of the natural evolution of how gnarly we keep getting and how more refined everyone sounds.
I'd say the majority of our fans now have seen our band live and know how gnarly and ferocious it is, so trying to compress that into a recording still is kind of difficult.
Like we'd say 'I thought we did it pretty well on Bears', and then we'd re-examine it and see there's still some elements that are missing.
"The band's influences steered away from the "traditional hardcore record" and took a wide variety of influences from indie rock bands like Fleet Foxes.
Cormier, when asked about his influences, stated: "In a lot of ways we get really inspired by non-metal bands.
For me, I find I really like looking at other things because I just don't want to make a traditional hardcore record lyrically.

nance logging is a type of well logging that uses the NMR response of a formation to directly determine its porosity and permeability, providing a continuous record along the length of the borehole.
NMR logging exploits the large magnetic moment of hydrogen, which is abundant in rocks in the form of water.
The NMR signal amplitude is proportional to the quantity of hydrogen nuclei present in a formation and can be calibrated to give a value for porosity that is free from lithology effects.
Uniquely, a petrophysicist can also analyse the rate of decay of the NMR signal amplitude to obtain information on the permeability of the formation - a crucial quantity in hydrocarbon exploration.
The most important mechanism affecting NMR relaxation is grain-surface relaxation.
Molecules in fluids are in constant Brownian motion, diffusing about the pore space and bouncing off the grain surfaces.
laxation most significantly depends on how often the hydrogen nuclei collide with the grain surface and this is controlled by the surface-to-volume ratio of the pore in which the nuclei are located.
Collisions are less frequent in larger pores, resulting in a slower decay of the NMR signal amplitude and allowing a petrophysicist to understand the distribution of pore sizes.

A shovel test pit is a standard method for Phase I of an archaeological survey.
It is usually a part of the Cultural Resources Management methodology and a popular form of rapid archaeological survey in the United States of America and Canada.
It designates a series of test holes, usually dug out by a shovel in order to determine whether the soil contains any cultural remains that are not visible on the surface.
The soil is sifted or screened through 1/4" or 6 mm wire mesh to recover the artifacts.
STPs will often be laid out over the project area in a grid-like fashion or in a consistently spaced line, creating a fairly systematic survey.
Therefore, after the holes have been dug, one may map artifact densities over the project area, pinpointing the locations of possible sites where further investigation may be necessary.
The interval at which the STPs are placed varies considerably and, in CRM at least, is sometimes prescribed by state regulations or is determined by the conditions in the field.
The current standards in the United States is 30m or less.

In linguistics, sound symbolism, phonesthesia or phonosemantics is the idea that vocal sounds or phonemes carry meaning in and of themselves.
However, it is Ferdinand de Saussure who is considered to be the founder of modern 'scientific' linguistics.
use to indicate things and concepts could be any words — they are essentially just a consensus agreed upon by the speakers of a language and have no discernible pattern or relationship to the thing.
Second, he says that, because words are arbitrary, they have meaning only in relation to other words.
A dog is a dog because it is not a cat or a mouse or a horse, etc.
These ideas have permeated the study of words since the 19th century.
Margaret Magnus is the author of a comprehensive book designed to explain phonosemantics to the lay reader: Gods in the Word.
This is the least significant type of symbolism.
It is simply imitative of sounds or suggests something that makes a sound.

Ptiolina obscura  is a species of 'snipe flies' belonging to the family Rhagionidae.
Flies of this genus are tiny and black, quite unlike the normal conception of Rhagionidae.
They may easily be mistaken for small Empididae and are little known probably because the species sometimes occur in considerable numbers for a very short period.
Ptiolina can be confused only with Spania or Symphoromyia.
Symphoromyia is distinguished by the kidney-shaped third antennal segment, or by having hairs on the metapleuron.
In Ptiolina the metapleura are bare.
Separating Ptiolina from Spania is more difficult.
The terminal style of the antenna is centrally placed in Ptiolina, Spania lacks a true style, but the ventral margin of the last antennal segment is produced into a pseudostyle.
The males are darker, more chocolate coloured than the females.
Ptiolina is a stem borer of mosses.

In integrated pest management, the economic threshold is the density of a pest at which a control treatment will provide an economic return.
An economic threshold is the insect's population level or extent of crop damage at which the value of the crop destroyed exceeds the cost of controlling the pest.
Economic thresholds can be expressed in a variety of ways including the number of insects per plant or per square metre, the amount of leaf surface damage, etc.
In many cases, thresholds have been established through scientific research.
Unfortunately, not all combinations of pests and crops have been studied, and some reported thresholds are educated estimates.

383 is a famous decision of the Supreme Court of Canada.
The Court upheld the Albertan provincial Communal Properties Act of 1955, which among other things, restricted the amount of land that could be owned by Hutterites and Doukhobors.
The Act required that those wishing to use land for communal colonies must first obtain the permission of the provincial government.

Paul Walter, not a Hutterite, wished to sell his land to a group of Hutterites and was prevented from doing so by the Communal Properties Act.

The Court unanimously upheld the Act.
The pith and substance of the Act, the Court said, related to land ownership in Alberta.
Accordingly, property within the province was a valid matter of provincial jurisdiction, even though it had an incidental effect on religion.

After the flight of Vostok 1, Sergei Korolev took a short vacation in Crimea where he began working out the flight plan for the next mission.
There were considerable arguments over the duration of the mission as flight doctors argued for no more than three orbits.
2 nine months earlier had carried two dogs on a six orbit mission, during which the animals had experienced convulsions and thus all subsequent Vostok missions were limited to three orbits maximum.
Although dogs and humans were very different physiologically, the doctors were worried about the risks posed on a longer flight.
There was also the purely practical aspect of spacecraft recovery.
If Vostok 2 flew three orbits, reentry and landing would take place in the wide open steppes of southern Russia, the landing site moving steadily further west with each orbit.
Orbits 8-13 would drop the capsule into the Pacific Ocean, after which landing would again occur in Soviet territory, but in the remote, frozen wastes of Siberia.

g of the Alpha chapter, Knox said that other fraternities being formed possessed "many objectionable features which rendered them liable to be used as engines of evil as well as instruments of good.
The five core values espoused by Beta Theta Pi are cultivation of intellect, responsible conduct, mutual assistance, integrity and trust.
These are the underpinnings for their mission statement to "develop men of principle for a principled life.
" In 1879, Beta Theta Pi became the first college fraternity to publish its constitution.
The fraternity continues to guard certain secrets about membership.

A transversely isotropic material is one with physical properties that are symmetric about an axis that is normal to a plane of isotropy.
This transverse plane has infinite planes of symmetry and thus, within this plane, the material properties are the same in all directions.
Hence, such materials are also known as "polar anisotropic" materials.
The tensors of electrical resistivity, permeability, etc.
have two independent constants.
An example of a transversely isotropic material is the so-called on-axis unidirectional fiber composite lamina where the fibers are circular in cross section.
In a unidirectional composite, the plane normal to the fiber direction can be considered as the isotropic plane, at long wavelengths of excitation.
In the figure to the right, the fibers would be aligned with the                x           2                {\displaystyle x_{2}}  axis, which is normal to the plane of isotropy.
In terms of effective properties, geological layers of rocks are often interpreted as being transversely isotropic.

An ephemeron is a data structure that solves two related problems in garbage collected systems.

On the other hand, an ephemeron allows data to be associated with some object without creating a reference to that object that will prevent the object from being collected.
the object that the ephemeron guards, notifying the system when that object is collectable, and the value can be any data associated with the object such as a property list, and which may be empty.
Since the elements of the property list may refer back to the key, they may prevent collection of that key.
But the ephemeron is treated specially by the garbage collector.
The value field is not traced until the key is found to be reachable from the system roots other than through ephemeron keys.
t of ephemerons whose keys are only reachable from ephemeron keys are then holding onto keys that are ready to be collected; these objects are not reachable from the roots except through ephemerons.
When the garbage collector detects such a set, the ephemerons are queued for notification and their keys and values are traced.
Hence ephemerons both detect objects that are ready for collection and break the cycles that can prevent objects from being collected.

Oothukkadu Venkata Kavi  or Oottukadu Venkata Subbaiah Iyer was one of the pioneering composers in Indian classical Carnatic music.
He lived in South India in the present-day state of Tamil Nadu.
Also known by the name Oothukkadu Venkatasubba Iyer, he composed hundreds of compositions in Sanskrit, Tamil and Marathi of which over 500 are available.
These were handed down from generation to generation by the descendants of the composer's brother's family.
Venkata Kavi's compositions reveal that he was a complete master of the science and art of music in all senses of the term – melody, rhythm or lyrics and was eloquent in Sanskrit and Tamil.
Renowned for his rare depth, scholarship and sublime appeal, he was proficient in a variety of musical forms such as the kriti, tillana and kavadichindu.
He used talas and themes that not many other Carnatic composers have preferred to handle.
His compositions are a blend of a high degree of scholarship on a variety of subjects and inspired expression.
While he has rightfully been acknowledged as one of the greatest composers on Krishna, Venkata Kavi composed hundreds of pieces on other deities too.
Several pieces also reveal his humility, reverence for the great personalities before his times and the high state of bliss that he probably experienced almost ceaselessly.
His works scarcely contain autobiographical notes and show that he had reached great spiritual and philosophical heights.

The Vision Montreal Crisis of 1997 was one of the most severe internal party crises in Montreal politics.
In January 1997, Mayor Pierre Bourque tried to dismiss two members of Montreal's Executive Committee: Deputy Chairman Sammy Forcillo and Pierre Goyer.
Yet, the city charter of 1921 clearly states that appointments to the Executive Committee are irrevocable.
Forcillo and Goyer left Vision Montreal to sit as independents, but exercised their right to stay on the committee.
Therefore, management by consensus became nearly impossible to reach for the remainder of Bourque's term.
That incident as well as allegations of authoritarian tendencies led thirteen other Vision Montreal councillors to leave the party and sit as independents with their colleagues of the opposition.
By August 1997, only a minority of the council members were members of Vision Montreal and the credibility of the Bourque administration was undermined.
efectors were supporters of Jacques Duchesneau's Nouveau Montréal party, but others backed Jean Doré's Équipe Montréal, the RCM or even came back to Vision Montreal briefly before the next election.
The severity of the crisis was such that for a while it appeared to seriously affect Bourque's chances of re-election.
Nonetheless, Bourque was re-elected in 1998, as were a substantial majority of his candidates.
The defectors were:Members of the Executive Committee are indicated with bold fonts.
Gamla was an ancient Jewish city on the Golan Heights.
ng the Great Revolt, it became an important stronghold for rebels and because of this Gamla is a symbol of heroism for the modern state of Israel and an important historical and archaeological site.
It lies within the current Gamla nature reserve and is a prominent tourist attraction.
Archaeological excavations have shown that in the place of Gamla there was already a settlement in the Early Bronze Age.
The settlement was probably agricultural, as archaeologists have found evidence of long-term use of flint sickles.
Some of the findings even go back to the Copper Age.
Around 2700 BCE, the settlement was abandoned until it was used as a military outpost by the Seleucids.
According to the Mishnah, the town of Gamla was encompassed by a wall before the Israelite conquest of Canaan under Joshua.
Modern-day archaeologists have suggested that the fort was abandoned before the arrival of the Israelites, which, even if that were the case, has no bearing on the antiquity of the wall itself.
The military career of Hugo Chávez spans the seventeen years that the later President of Venezuela spent in the Venezuelan army.
his professed and self-proclaimed democratic socialist governance, his promotion of Latin American integration, and his radical critique of neoliberal globalization and United States foreign policy.
Born 28 July 1954 in rural Sabaneta, Chávez entered military service upon his graduation from the Military academy of Venezuela in 1975, as a military officer.
Chávez thereafter held a variety of post, command, and staff positions.
At the time, he was increasingly drawn into leftist political movements; he eventually engaged in electioneering and political conspiracy.
Chávez led a violent 1992 civilian-military coup which sought to overthrow a democratically elected government that he saw as a corrupt oligarchy.
Although the coup ultimately failed—ending Chávez's military career—it also brought Chávez into the national spotlight and set the stage for his future rise to political power.
After his undergraduate studies concluded in 1975, Chávez entered active-duty military service.
Despite this, Chávez saw little actual combat; this was due to a low density of insurgent activity in the Cumaná region.

In compiler theory, partial redundancy elimination is a compiler optimization that eliminates expressions that are redundant on some but not necessarily all paths through a program.
PRE is a form of common subexpression elimination.
An expression is called partially redundant if the value computed by the expression is already available on some but not all paths through a program to that expression.
An expression is fully redundant if the value computed by the expression is available on all paths through the program to that expression.
minate partially redundant expressions by inserting the partially redundant expression on the paths that do not already compute it, thereby making the partially redundant expression fully redundant.
For instance, in the following code:the expression x+4 assigned to z is partially redundant because it is computed twice if some_condition is true.
de motion on the expression to yield the following optimized code:An interesting property of PRE is that it performs common subexpression elimination and loop-invariant code motion at the same time.
In addition, PRE can be extended to eliminate injured partial redundancies, thereby effectively performing strength reduction.
This makes PRE one of the most important optimizations in optimizing compilers.
s, but recently formulations of PRE based on static single assignment form have been published that apply the PRE algorithm to values instead of expressions, unifying PRE and global value numbering.

Shevtsova was born in Izvaryne, Krasnodon District in 24 September 1924 to a working-class Russian family.
Her father had fought in the First World War and the Russian Civil War on the side of the Red Army; her mother worked at a field hospital as a nurse.
Her family moved within the limits of Krasnodon city in 1927, where she graduated from seven grades of school before applying to a theater school in Rostov.
However, the German invasion of the Soviet Union began shortly after she applied.
Shortly after the start of the war Shevtsova attended brief nursing classes and tried to enlist as a nurse in the Red Army, but was rejected for being too young at the time.
So she joined the Komsomol in February 1942 and upon the recommendation of the Voroshilovgrad District Committee she began training to become a radio operator for the Young Guard in April.
After completing the course and swearing an oath of allegiance she began transmitting information collected by the partisans to the Red Army Intelligence Center.
from the Germans, and participated in burning down the Labour Exchange building, which contained documents with the names of people that were to be deported and forced into hard labour for Germany.

The M1877 was a short barreled breech-loading mortar.
The barrel was a typical built-up gun of the period with reinforcing hoops which was built from cast iron and steel.
The mortar had an early form of Krupp horizontal sliding-block breech and it fired separate-loading, bagged charges and projectiles.
ing a large shell at a high-angle was more likely to destroy an enemy ship by penetrating its thin deck armor than a high-velocity low-angle naval gun attempting to penetrate its thicker belt armor.
The downside was that high-angle indirect fire was harder to aim correctly so more mortars would be needed to defend an area from attack.
However, if the area was constrained by geography like a port at the mouth of a river the navigation channels could be measured ahead of time and firing ranges calculated.
A complicating factor was as naval artillery progressed their size and range soon eclipsed the mortar's range.
In the coastal defense role, the M1877 was mounted on a garrison mount which sat on a concrete slab behind a parapet.
The mount consisted of a rectangular steel firing platform with a pivot at the front and two wheels at the rear to give a limited amount of traverse.
The recoil system for the M1877 consisted of a U shaped gun cradle which held the trunnioned barrel and a slightly inclined firing platform with a hydro-gravity recoil system.

In configuration management , one has to control changes made to software and documentation.
This is called revision control, which manages multiple versions of the same unit of information.
Although revision control is important to CM, it is not equal to it.
Synchronization Models, also known as Configuration Management Models , describe methods to enable revision control through allowing simultaneous, concurrent changes to individual files.
Feiler reports on four different synchronization models, shortly described below.
Check-outcheck-in model, files are stored individually in a repository from which they are checked out whenever the files are accessed, and checked in when they have changed.
This repository can store multiple versions of the files.
Because these files can be documentation or source code, but can also be a collection of files, the term Configuration item will be used from now on.
The basic mechanism used to prevent conflicts by simultaneous modifications is that of locking.
The composition model is an extension on the check-out/check-in model.

Some bioterrorism agents, like the smallpox virus, can be spread from person to person and some, like anthrax, cannot.

In medicine, split hand syndrome is a neurological syndrome in which the hand muscles on the side of the thumb appear wasted, whereas the muscles on the side of the little finger are spared.
Anatomically, the abductor pollicis brevis and first dorsal interosseous muscle are more wasted than the abductor digiti minimi.
If lesions affecting the branches of the ulnar nerve that run to the wasted muscles are excluded, the lesion is almost sure to be located in the anterior horn of the spinal cord at the C8-T1 level.
It can also occur in other disorders affecting the anterior horn, such as spinal muscular atrophy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, poliomyelitis and progressive muscular atrophy.

Powerlifting is a strength sport that consists of three attempts at maximal weight on three lifts: squat, bench press, and deadlift.
As in the sport of Olympic weightlifting, it involves the athlete attempting a maximal weight single lift of a barbell loaded with weight plates.
Powerlifting evolved from a sport known as "odd lifts", which followed the same three-attempt format but used a wider variety of events, akin to strongman competition.
Eventually odd lifts became standardized to the current three.
Equipment in this context refers to a supportive bench shirt or squat/deadlift suit or briefs.
In some federations, knee wraps are permitted in the equipped but not un-equipped division; in others, they may be used in both equipped and un-equipped lifting.
Weight belts, knee sleeves, wrist wraps and special footwear may also be used, but are not considered when distinguishing equipped from un-equipped lifting.
Competitions take place across the world.
Powerlifting has been a Paralympic sport since 1984 and, under the IPF, is also a World Games sport.
The roots of powerlifting are found in traditions of strength training stretching back as far as ancient Greek and ancient Persian times.

Atmospheric dispersion modeling is the mathematical simulation of how air pollutants disperse in the ambient atmosphere.
It is performed with computer programs that include algorithms to solve the mathematical equations that govern the pollutant dispersion.
spersion models are used to estimate the downwind ambient concentration of air pollutants or toxins emitted from sources such as industrial plants, vehicular traffic or accidental chemical releases.
Therefore, they are the dominant type of model used in air quality policy making.
They are most useful for pollutants that are dispersed over large distances and that may react in the atmosphere.
For pollutants that have a very high spatio-temporal variability and for epidemiological studies statistical land-use regression models are also used.
Dispersion models are important to governmental agencies tasked with protecting and managing the ambient air quality.

Vibration is a mechanical phenomenon whereby oscillations occur about an equilibrium point.
The oscillations may be periodic, such as the motion of a pendulum—or random, such as the movement of a tire on a gravel road.
Vibration can be desirable: for example, the motion of a tuning fork, the reed in a woodwind instrument or harmonica, a mobile phone, or the cone of a loudspeaker.
In many cases, however, vibration is undesirable, wasting energy and creating unwanted sound.
For example, the vibrational motions of engines, electric motors, or any mechanical device in operation are typically unwanted.
Such vibrations could be caused by imbalances in the rotating parts, uneven friction, or the meshing of gear teeth.
Careful designs usually minimize unwanted vibrations.
The studies of sound and vibration are closely related.

The Missouri Ozark Forest Ecosystem Project is a century-long ecological experiment to assess logging practices in the Missouri Ozark forest.
Its goal is to find out a logging method that best balances the demand for wood products with forest preservation.
Forest Service, and Missouri universities are participating in the project.
The project uses 9,000 acres of state forest land as experimental tracts.
That land is divided into nine compartments.
One group of three compartments is a control group and experiences no logging.
The second group is logged in an "even-aged" manner, with swaths comprising ten percent of each compartment logged every ten years.
The third group is logged in an "uneven-aged" manner, with selective logging of trees throughout the three compartments in that group.
The uneven-aged management style creates a forest with trees of various ages and sizes.
In the two groups that are cut, 10% of trees are left uncut, to preserve them as old growth forest.

Venusberg is the second novel by the English writer Anthony Powell.
Published in 1932, it is set in an unidentified Baltic country which draws clearly on Powell's experiences in Finland and Estonia.
Some see the novel as part of the Ruritanian tradition , perhaps a modernist pastiche of the form.
The novel continues Powell's humorously critical examination of society, its various forms and fashions, this time against a background largely removed from London and English life.
Romantic entanglements and the dissatisfactions of love remain a major concern and the novel maintains Powell's characteristic mingling of comedy and embarrassment.
Of Powell's novels, Venusberg makes the greatest use of short chapters and quick changes of scene in the plot.
As might be supposed from the title, the novel treats aspects of the Tannhäuser legend.
The Baedeker quotation Powell uses as an epigraph is a key to understanding the role the Tannhäuser legend plays.

Kikuchi did not formally join the band while Potpourri was being recorded, leading Hirasawa and keyboardist Yasumi Tanaka to play bass parts on the album, each doing the songs they wrote.
Potpourri has a harsher and more off-putting sound than previous albums, with P-Model employing different instruments and experimental recording techniques.
Guitar is more prominent than the keyboard-centric albums from before, leaving synthesizers to go almost unused.
Hirasawa incorporates greater antagonism into his vocals, sometimes to the point of screaming them.
The album alienated P-Model's fanbase, leaving only a core audience that would persist with Hirasawa throughout his career.

oftware component of a network video recorder and digital video recorder, though in general a VMS tends to be more sophisticated and provide more options and capabilities than a packaged NVR device.
Due to improvements in technology, it is necessary to make a distinction between a VMS and the built-in features of modern network based security cameras.
However a camera's built-in web interface is typically exclusive to the camera itself and does not normally provide a shared access capability across other network cameras.
Optionally, a VMS may also provide additional features and capabilities.
The extent of these capabilities may be divided across several product tiers, with the lower cost VMS products having fewer features.
Rather than continuously recording data, a VMS may also implement motion detection to reduce the amount of data to be recorded.
With modern megapixel network cameras, the cameras are much more sophisticated.
Motion detection can now be distributed, so that the cameras do motion detection themselves and only send video when motion is detected.
Some VMS do not have motion detection and rely exclusively on it being done in the camera.
A difficulty with modern megapixel network cameras is the variety of standards and industry compliance with those standards.

Based on the industrial process of vacuum forming, a rectangular piece of plastic was clamped in a holder and heated over a metal plate.
When the plastic was soft, the holder was swung to the other side, over a mold of the object to be formed.
Then quickly and repeatedly pressing down on a spring-loaded handle on the side of the unit created a vacuum, sucking the plastic down over the mold and shaping it to it.
When the plastic cooled it solidified, making an impression of the item.
Various molds came with the kit.
Several expansion kits were also available for molding various other shapes.
In actual use almost any small object that could withstand the temperature of the heated plastic sheet for a few seconds could be used as a mold.
Plastic refill sheets came in a variety of colors.
's VAC-U-FORM toy is well made and many are still in use today both as a toy and for small size part production in conjunction with other hobbies such as making R/C aircraft cowling and other parts.
Because very hot surfaces were easily accessible to a child playing with the toy, it probably could not be sold today due to safety restrictions.

It is an expansion of a 2014 article published in The Federalist.

Combined spinal and epidural anaesthesia is a regional anaesthetic technique, which combines the benefits of both spinal anaesthesia and epidural anaesthesia and analgesia.
The spinal component gives a rapid onset of a predictable block.
The indwelling epidural catheter gives the ability to provide long lasting analgesia and to titrate the dose given to the desired effect.
This technique is suitable whenever a rapid onset of analgesia is required but the period of analgesia required exceeds that of a single spinal injection.
order to have a quicker termination of the spinal anaesthesia, but still having the catheter available in case the patient requires more than the minimal amount of medication to remain comfortable.
hoped that this technique for caesarean section would yield greater maternal satisfaction with less hypotension and its associated nausea, but it is not clear that the technique has many advantages.
This technique also allows for post operative pain relief via epidural patient controlled anaesthesia.
The epidural catheter may be left in place for up to 72 hours if required.
In labouring women, the onset of analgesia is more rapid with CSE compared with epidural analgesia.
CSE in labour was formerly thought to enable women to mobilise for longer compared with epidural analgesia, but this is not supported by a recent Cochrane review.
In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence specifically recommends CSE for women who require rapid onset of analgesia in labour.

carteri forms small spherical colonies, or coenobia, of 2000-6000 Chlamydomonas-type somatic cells and 12-16 large, potentially immortal reproductive cells called gonidia.
While vegetative, male and female colonies are indistinguishable; however, in the sexual phase, females produce 35-45 eggs and males produce up to 50 sperm packets with 64 or 128 sperm each.
the evolution of multicellularity and organismal complexity, largely due to its simple differentiation into two cell types, versatility in controlled laboratory environments, and natural abundance.
Volvox carteri is a useful model organism for understanding the evolution and developmental genetics of cellular differentiation, in part because asexual colonies possess only two cell types.
Approximately 2000 biflagellated somatic cells form a monolayer at the surface of the extracellular matrix and cannot divide, rendering them mortal.
They facilitate motility in response to changes in light concentration , which is detected via an orange photoreceptor-containing eyespot.
Gonidia, by contrast, are immobile, embedded in the ECM interior, and are potentially immortal due to their ability to divide and participate in reproduction.

Masaru Emoto was a Japanese author and pseudoscientist who said that human consciousness has an effect on the molecular structure of water.
d his early work revolved around pseudoscientific hypotheses that water could react to positive thoughts and words and that polluted water could be cleaned through prayer and positive visualization.
His conjectures are regarded as un-scientific and have been proved wrong, and his approach has been shown to contain many methodological mistakes and/or manipulations.
Since 1999, Emoto published several volumes of a work entitled Messages from Water, which contain photographs of ice crystals and their accompanying experiments.
Emoto was born in Yokohama, Japan, and graduated from Yokohama Municipal University after taking courses in International Relations.
In the mid-1990s, he began studying water in more detail.
Emoto was President Emeritus of the International Water For Life Foundation, a non-profit organization based in Oklahoma City in the United States.
oto became a Doctor of Alternative Medicine at the Open International University for Alternative Medicine in India, a diploma mill which targeted quacks to sell it's degrees and was later shut down.
Emoto said that water was a "blueprint for our reality" and that emotional "energies" and "vibrations" could change the physical structure of water.
riments consisted of exposing water in glasses to different words, pictures, or music and then freezing and examining the aesthetic properties of the resulting crystals with microscopic photography.
exposed to positive speech and thoughts would result in visually "pleasing" crystals being formed when that water was frozen and that negative intention would yield "ugly" frozen crystal formations.
Emoto held that different water sources would produce different crystalline structures when frozen.
in stream when frozen would show structures of beautifully shaped geometric design, but those structures would be distorted and randomly formed if the sample were taken from a polluted water source.

During the 19 months in which the US participated in World War I, several attempts were made to design competent single-seat fighters of original design.
Among these was the Heinrich Pursuit, conceived in 1917 by Albert Heinrich and built by the Victor Aircraft Corporation.
Aerodynamically clean, the Pursuit was a single-bay, unequal-span biplane, powered by a 100 hp Gnome engine.
Two examples were ordered by the US Army Signal Corps.
The first was delivered in November 1917, and underwent field testing at McCook Field, Dayton, Ohio.
However, at the time US Air Force policy was to forego fighters of national design in favour of more tested foreign types.
Nevertheless, the Pursuit was considered to have potential as a fighter trainer, and two more aircraft were ordered.
These were powered by a more reliable 80 hp Le Rhône engine, and had a strengthened cabane and paired struts.

Greeks from neighbouring islands had arrived on Chios and encouraged the Chians to join their revolt.
In response, Ottoman troops landed on the island and killed thousands.
The massacre of Christians provoked international outrage, and led to increasing support for the Greek cause worldwide.
For over 2,000 years, Chios merchants and shipowners had been prominent in trade and diplomacy throughout the Black Sea, the Aegean, and the Mediterranean.
The Ottoman Empire allowed Chios almost complete control over its own affairs as Chian trade and the very highly-valued mastic plant harvested only on Chios were of great value to it.
The cosmopolitan Chians were also very prominent in Constantinople.
Following the massacre, however, the island never regained its commercial prominence.
The island's ruling classes were reluctant to join the Greek revolt, fearing the loss of their security and prosperity.

The Goodness Paradox: The Strange Relationship Between Virtue and Violence in Human Evolution is a book by British primatologist Richard Wrangham.
Darwin disagreed, as have most evolutionary biologists since.
Dodge in dividing human aggression into two types.
The first type, "reactive aggression" is when individuals attack in response to provocation.
The second type, "proactive aggression" is planned, premeditated, and involves deliberate tactical strikes.
To explain his idea, Wrangham invited readers to imagine a commercial airline flight.
Other primates crowded into such a space would react by, in Hawks' words, "ripping one another limb from limb.
" Humans do not because they have a comparatively very low tendency to reactive aggression.
Proactive aggression, by contrast, is so highly developed in humans that we must put elaborate security measures in place to prevent others from carrying out plans to bring the plane down.
Wrangham offers a new perspective on a topic that has been investigated notably by Konrad Lorenz and Erich Fromm, whose research is briefly acknowledged.

The South African Railways gas-electric locomotive of 1923 was an experimental gas-electric locomotive.
The fuel, suction gas, was generated on-board the locomotive from coal.
In 1923, the South African Railways experimented with gas-electric motive power and constructed a single experimental producer gas-electric locomotive.
emained in service for several years and was followed by another, built by the General Electric Company, which was not successful and never entered line service after undergoing experimental trials.
The gas-electric concept was eventually superseded by diesel-electric traction.
The non-profitability of many branch line operations had been a problem for the South African Railways from the outset.
n to the fact that, in isolated districts with vast agricultural and mineral capabilities in many parts of the Union of South Africa, development was hampered by the lack of means of transportation.
Diesel and diesel-electric locomotives were still in their infancy and were therefore not yet an attractive proposition, while the cost of electrification of such branch lines would be prohibitive.
During October 1922, Hoy encouraged further experiments to determine the practicability of the use of suction gas as fuel for an alternative form of motive power, suitable for use on branch lines.

Boraginoideae is a subfamily of the flowering plant family Boraginaceae, as that family is defined in the APG III system of classification for flowering plants.
The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group has not actually specified subfamilies within Boraginaceae.
Some taxonomists place the genera Codon and Wellstedia in Boraginoideae.
Others place one or both of these in separate, monogeneric subfamilies.
Codon was long regarded as an odd member of Hydrophylloideae, but in 1998, a molecular phylogenetic study showed that it is closer to Boraginoideae.
Many of the botanists who work with Boraginaceae do not follow the APG III system.
Instead, they recognize five to eight families in the order Boraginales.
Comparisons of DNA sequences by cladistic methods have strongly supported the division of Boraginoideae into four tribes: Echiochileae, Boragineae, Lithospermeae, and Cynoglosseae.

An anthelion is a rare optical phenomenon of the halo family.
It appears on the parhelic circle opposite to the sun as a faint white spot, not unlike a sundog, and may be crossed by an X-shaped pair of diffuse arcs.
How anthelia are formed is disputed.
g others, has argued they are not separate haloes, but simply where various haloes caused by horizontally oriented column-shaped ice crystals coincide on the parhelic circle to create a bright spot.
If this theory is correct, anthelia should only appear together with these other haloes.
However, anthelia occur unaccompanied by other plate crystal haloes, thus scientists have produced alternative explanations.
Visser proposed they form by two exterior light reflections in quadrangular prisms, while Robert Greenler has suggested two interior reflections in column-shaped crystals produces the phenomenon.
thelion area is usually sparse on haloes, in a complex display it features various rare optic phenomena: Flanking the anthelion on the parhelic circle are two 120° parhelia caused by plate crystals.
The Tricker and diffuse arcs are produced in singly oriented column crystals and form an Ankh-like shape passing through the anthelion.
Wegener arcs occasionally cross the sky to converge in the anthelion.
Genderqueer fashion is fashion among genderqueer people that goes beyond common style conventions that usually associate certain colors and shapes with one of the two binary genders.
ceived by consumers as a fashion style that focuses on experimenting garments based on people's different body shapes instead of following the restrictions given by gendered clothing categorization.
Genderqueer style is characterized by the choice to not conform to gender norms assigned at birth.
Its purpose is to redefine what is considered feminine and masculine.
This differentiation between gender norms through clothing became preponderant during the nineteenth century and it mainly involved different fabrics, trims and constructions for different genders.
Those distinctions were meant to mirror gender roles in society as masculine clothing aimed to be practical while female fashion was perceived as purely aesthetic.
Therefore, there is a historical dimension to the association between fashion and gender identity.
y is recognized by the LGBT community as a very personal and subjective behaviour; genderqueer style is therefore intrinsically tied to identity, and as such, it includes a vast range of aesthetics.
idge between individual identity and society: the genderqueer fashion style tries to recode this relation, although encountering several restrictions in the mass production of commonly binary goods.
These restrictions denote the political nature of genderqueer fashion.
According to an article that featured the writer and activist Alok Vaid-Menon, fashion represents the inherent politics of each individual artist or human.
For genderqueer people, as for transgender people, whose life and relationship with the body is hardly acknowledged by society, existence itself is political.
that there is an additional layer of risk for humans assigned male at birth who want to present feminine by wearing dresses and makeup, since the act itself is likely to attract unwanted attention.

uides some bureaucrats to a crashed spaceship that may be leaking some dangerous materials, radioactive, toxic and otherwise hazardous by-products which were destined to be thrown into a black hole.
The bureaucrats swear that it is "perfectly safe.
" When asked why they want to see it if that is true, they claim that they "like looking at things that are perfectly safe.
"The comic asides in the story include some of the time travel paradoxes which are a common running theme in Adams' SF work, and plenty of material about lobsters.
Since this was before Zaphod blocked off sections of his own brain for the presidency, readers are able to glimpse what his original personality was like.
His general speech patterns and goof-off personality are the same, but he seems to have moral views and is more likely to go off on life-threatening and exciting quests for the greater good.

Pressure shadows that contain fibrous mineral textures are also termed pressure fringes or strain fringes.
During deformation, minerals can migrate by plastic flow or may grow by diffusive mass transport into the lower-stress regions created by a rigid porphyroclast or porphyroblast.

North Sea Wind Power Hub is a proposed energy island complex to be built in the middle of the North Sea as part of a European system for sustainable electricity.
rea in the North Sea, just outside the continental shelf of the United Kingdom and near the point where the borders between the territorial waters of Netherlands, Germany, and Denmark come together.
ish electrical grid operators are cooperating in this project to help develop a cluster of offshore wind parks with a capacity of several gigawatts, with interconnections to the North Sea countries.
Undersea cables will make international trade in electricity possible.
According to this plan, the first artificial island will have an area of 6 square kilometers.
Thousands of wind turbines will be placed around the island, with short alternating-current links to the island.
On the island itself, power converters will change the alternating current to direct current that will be carried to the mainland via undersea cables.
une 2016, nine countries – the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, Luxemburg, France, Denmark, Ireland, Norway, and Sweden – signed an agreement to cooperate in planning and building offshore wind parks.
The goal is to reduce costs as quickly as possible and thus make the wind parks more economically viable.

Parks and open spaces cover about 21 percent of the watershed, while single-family homes dominate most of the remainder.
The largest of the parks is the state natural area, which straddles the border between the two cities and counties.
The bedrock under the watershed includes part of the last exotic terrane, a chain of seamounts, acquired by the North American Plate as it moved west during the Eocene.
Known as the Waverly Hills Formation, it lies buried under ash and lava from later volcanic eruptions, sediments from flooding and erosion, and layers of wind-blown silt.
Two dormant volcanoes from the Boring Lava Field are in the Tryon Creek watershed.

Jumble ice is a phenomenon that occurs when ice atop a river or other flowing body of water fractures due to the different flow rates beneath the ice.
On a lake, pond, or other stationary body of water, ice forms undisturbed and generally does not move as long as the entire surface of the body of water is frozen.
When a river freezes, water flow typically continues beneath the ice, exerting pressure on it.
If the ice fractures, pieces of ice torn free by the river's current will collide with stationary or slower-moving pieces.
After becoming stuck in place, the loosened pieces of ice refreeze irregularly, causing a rough, or jumbled, surface.
In general, the faster a body of water flows beneath ice, the more likely it is to develop jumble ice.
Temperatures near the freezing point also tend to cause jumble ice, as the higher temperatures weaken the ice structure, allowing for more pieces to be torn free before refreezing.
The Yukon River in Alaska often exhibits jumble ice during the winter.
Jumble ice is a hazard for winter travelers, as the broken "ground" formed by the jumble ice can cause snowmachine accidents or injuries to sled dogs.

Griffith CJ, O'Connor J agreeing, held that the Arbitration Court could not make an award that was inconsistent with the minimum wages fixed by a Wages Board under a State law.
ation was a judicial or legislative function, the position of federal awards in relation to a conflict of laws and the facts necessary to establish the existence of an interstate industrial dispute.
opinions of Griffith CJ and O'Connor J was the reserved powers doctrine, that the powers of the Australian Parliament were limited to preserve the powers that were intended to be left to the States.
The reserved powers doctrine was challenged by Isaacs and Higgins JJ and ultimately abandoned by the High Court in 1920 in the Engineers' Case.
J approached the arbitral function as an exercise of judicial power, this would also be subsequently rejected by the High Court resolving that arbitration was the exercise of a legislative function.

three inaugural 'federalist' judges, Griffith CJ, Barton & O'Connor JJ had all opposed the industrial dispute power, while the two 'nationalist' judges, Isaacs & Higgins JJ had supported the power.

In biology, the SECIS element is an RNA element around 60 nucleotides in length that adopts a stem-loop structure.
SECIS elements are thus a fundamental aspect of messenger RNAs encoding selenoproteins, proteins that include one or more selenocysteine residues.
In bacteria the SECIS element appears soon after the UGA codon it affects.
In archaea and eukaryotes, it occurs in the 3' UTR of an mRNA, and can cause multiple UGA codons within the mRNA to code for selenocysteine.
particular nucleotides tend to be at particular positions in it, and a characteristic secondary structure.
The secondary structure is the result of base-pairing of complementary RNA nucleotides, and causes a hairpin-like structure.
The eukaryotic SECIS element includes non-canonical A-G base pairs, which are uncommon in nature, but are critically important for correct SECIS element function.

The magnetic quantum number is one of four quantum numbers in atomic physics.
The set is: principal quantum number, azimuthal quantum number, magnetic quantum number, and spin quantum number.
Together, they describe the unique quantum state of an electron.
The magnetic quantum number distinguishes the orbitals available within a subshell, and is used to calculate the azimuthal component of the orientation of orbital in space.
The value of ml can range from -ℓ to +ℓ, inclusive of zero.
Thus the s, p, d, and f subshells contain 1, 3, 5, and 7 orbitals each, with values of m within the ranges 0, ±1, ±2, ±3 respectively.
Each of these orbitals can accommodate up to two electrons , forming the basis of the periodic table.
There is a set of quantum numbers associated with the energy states of the atom.
l } ,           m       {\displaystyle m} , and           s       {\displaystyle s}  specify the complete and unique quantum state of a single electron in an atom called its wavefunction or orbital.

366 , is a Supreme Court of the United States case regarding the reasonableness of the arrest of a passenger in an automobile.
; searched the car, seizing $763 from the glove compartment and cocaine from behind the back-seat armrest; and arrested the car's three occupants after they denied ownership of the drugs and money.
gle, the front-seat passenger, was convicted of possession with intent to distribute cocaine and possession of cocaine, and was sentenced to 10 years incarceration without the possibility of parole.
finding of cocaine in the back armrest when Pringle was a front-seat passenger in a car being driven by its owner was insufficient to establish probable cause for an arrest for possession of drugs.
Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.
Because the officer had probable cause to arrest Pringle, the arrest did not contravene the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.
ryland law authorizes police officers to execute warrantless arrests where the officer has probable cause to believe that a felony has been committed or is being committed in the officer's presence.
the officer, upon recovering the suspected cocaine, had probable cause to believe a felony had been committed; the question is whether he had probable cause to believe Pringle committed that crime.

Troodontidae is a family of bird-like theropod dinosaurs.
During most of the 20th century, troodontid fossils were few and incomplete and they have therefore been allied, at various times, with many dinosaurian lineages.
More recent fossil discoveries of complete and articulated specimens , have helped to increase understanding about this group.
roodontids, like Sinovenator, demonstrate striking anatomical similarities with Archaeopteryx and primitive dromaeosaurids, and demonstrate that they are relatives comprising a clade called Paraves.
Troodontids are a group of small, bird-like, gracile maniraptorans.
All troodontids have unique features of the skull, such as large numbers of closely spaced teeth in the lower jaw.
Troodontids have sickle-claws and raptorial hands, and some of the highest non-avian encephalization quotients, suggesting that they were behaviourally advanced and had keen senses.
They had unusually long legs compared to other theropods, with a large, curved claw on their retractable second toes, similar to the "sickle-claw" of the dromaeosaurids.
However, the sickle-claws of troodontids were not as large or recurved as in their relatives, and in some instances could not be held off the ground and "retracted" to the same degree.
In at least one troodontid, Borogovia, the second toe could not be held far off the ground at all and the claw was straight, not curved or sickle-like.

The VESA Local Bus was a short-lived expansion bus introduced during the i486 generation of x86 IBM compatible personal computers.
Created by VESA the VESA Local Bus worked alongside the then dominant ISA bus to provide a standardized high-speed conduit intended primarily to accelerate video operations.
In the early 1990s, the I/O bandwidth of the prevailing ISA bus had become a critical bottleneck to PC video and graphics performance.
The need for faster graphics was driven by increased adoption of graphical user interfaces in PC operating systems.
produce a viable successor to ISA with the Micro Channel Architecture, it failed in the market due to IBM's requirement to license and payment of licensing fees by hardware manufacturers to use it.
yalty free ISA bus in the form of EISA open standard was developed to counter MCA, it was unable to offer enough improvement over ISA to meet the dramatic increase in bandwidth desired for graphics.
where video card manufacturers and motherboard chipset makers created their own proprietary implementations of local buses to provide graphics cards direct access to the processor and system memory.
This avoided the limitations of the ISA bus while being less costly than a "licensed IBM MCA machine.
" It is important to note that at the time a migration to an MCA architecture machine from an ISA one was not insubstantial.
MCA machines generally did not offer ISA slots, thus a migration to MCA architecture meant that any prior investment in ISA cards was made unusable.
combined with MCA's greater technical requirements and expense to implement it did had the effect of making an MCA version of a peripheral card significantly more expensive than its ISA counterpart.

In geometry an equilateral pentagon is a polygon with five sides of equal length.
Its five internal angles, in turn, can take a range of sets of values, thus permitting it to form a family of pentagons.
The requirement is that all angles must add up to 540 degrees and must be between 0 and 360 degrees but not equal to 180 degrees.
Four intersecting equal circles arranged in a closed chain are sufficient to determine a convex equilateral pentagon.
Each circle's center is one of four vertices of the pentagon.
The remaining vertex is determined by one of the intersection points of the first and the last circle of the chain.
It is possible to describe any convex equilateral pentagon with only two angles α and β with α ≥ β provided the fourth angle is the smallest of the rest of the angles.
Thus the general equilateral pentagon can be regarded as a bivariate function f where the rest of the angles can be obtained by using trigonometric relations.
The equilateral pentagon described in this manner will be unique up to a rotation in the plane.

The digestive cavity has only one opening for both ingestion and egestion ; as a result, the food cannot be processed continuously.
narians, and three entirely parasitic groups: Cestoda, Trematoda and Monogenea; however, since the turbellarians have since been proven not to be monophyletic, this classification is now deprecated.
Free-living flatworms are mostly predators, and live in water or in shaded, humid terrestrial environments, such as leaf litter.
Cestodes and trematodes have complex life-cycles, with mature stages that live as parasites in the digestive systems of fish or land vertebrates, and intermediate stages that infest secondary hosts.
trematodes are excreted from their main hosts, whereas adult cestodes generate vast numbers of hermaphroditic, segment-like proglottids that detach when mature, are excreted, and then release eggs.
Unlike the other parasitic groups, the monogeneans are external parasites infesting aquatic animals, and their larvae metamorphose into the adult form after attaching to a suitable host.
However, analyses since the mid-1980s have separated out one subgroup, the Acoelomorpha, as basal bilaterians—closer to the original bilaterians than to any other modern groups.

A reamer is a type of rotary cutting tool used in metalworking.
Precision reamers are designed to enlarge the size of a previously formed hole by a small amount but with a high degree of accuracy to leave smooth sides.
There are also non-precision reamers which are used for more basic enlargement of holes or for removing burrs.
The process of enlarging the hole is called reaming.
There are many different types of reamer and they may be designed for use as a hand tool or in a machine tool, such as a milling machine or drill press.
A typical reamer consists of a set of parallel straight or helical cutting edges along the length of a cylindrical body.
Each cutting edge is ground at a slight angle and with a slight undercut below the cutting edge.
Reamers must combine both hardness in the cutting edges, for long life, and toughness, so that the tool does not fail under the normal forces of use.
They should only be used to remove small amounts of material.
This ensures a long life for the reamer and a superior finish to the hole.

The River Effra is a former stream or small river in south London, England, now culverted for most of its course.
Once a tributary of the River Thames, flows from the Effra were incorporated in the Victorian era into a combined sewer draining much of the historic area of Peckham and Brixton.
The etymology of the name "Effra" has been much disputed.
There is no evidence that it was applied to the stream before the late 18th century, and early 19th century gazetteers gave it no name.
from [the Latin word] Effrena", that it was from a Celtic root "yfrid" or that it derived from an Anglo-Saxon placename "heah efre" recorded in a charter of 693 for a spot on the bank of the Thames.
ggestion is that the name is a corruption of the place-name "Heathrow", the name of a manor which once covered some 70 acres south of present day Coldharbour Lane and east of present day Effra Road.
By the 1790s the land making up the Manor of Heathrow was known as Effra Farm.
There is evidence that the name was first applied to the stream at Brixton, perhaps taken from the name of the farm, and was only later extended to the rest of its course.
A 2016 book by the Lambeth archivist supports this view and suggests other etymologies are a product of 19th century antiquarianism.

The popeye shiner is a North American species of freshwater cyprinid fish.
o the United States, particularly the Ohio River basin and the Tennessee River drainage, spanning the states of Alabama, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and West Virginia.
Specific locations include the Tennessee River in Alabama and Georgia; the Wabash River in Indiana; and the Cheat River, Kanawha River , and New River in West Virginia.
Between 1894 and 1949, only three specimens had been definitively identified.
Later, however, the number of Popeye shiners began to increase, even in places that had been well documented previously and showed no trace of the Popeye shiner.
Popeye shiners are freshwater insectivores.
They consume aquatic insects, including midges, caddisflies, mayflies, and beetles.
These benthopelagic fish are found in temperate waters, particularly large creeks and small rivers that are extremely clear and have gravel bottoms.
The bodies of water in which they are found also tend to have slow to moderate flow.
It is precisely the water flow and preferred clarity of water that makes survival difficult.
Since the popeye shiner lives in pristine clear water, any contamination may adversely affect this property and subsequently diminish the ability of these fish to thrive.

WLOT-LP channel 46 was a 19kW low-power Class A television station in Watertown, New York.
It was Watertown's affiliate for the now-defunct UPN network, as well as the America One network, and was rebroadcast on co-owned WBQZ-LP channel 34, in the area to the northwest of Watertown.

Both stations were listed for sale in January 2003, at one point appearing on eBay with a $950,000 asking price.
uisition by Clear Channel Communications in September 2003 at a price of $180000 ultimately fell through, leaving DiMarcantonio to attempt to find individual investors to buy equity in the stations.
Clear Channel at that time owned WWTI , now Newport Television.

The NER model is one of a number of methods for determining the accuracy of live subtitles in television broadcasts and events that are produced using speech recognition.
The three letters stand for number, edition error and recognition error.
It is an alternative to the WER model used in several countries.
The model contains a formula to determine the quality of live subtitles: a NER value of 100 indicates that the content was subtitled entirely correctly.
This overall score is calculated as follows: Firstly, the number of edit and recognition errors is deducted from the total number of words in the live subtitles.
This number is then divided by the total number of words in the live subtitles and finally multiplied by one hundred.
recognition errorThis measurement process is already used for public television broadcasts in several European countries like Italy and Switzerland.
Other countries and authorities like British Ofcom have already expressed an interest.
By way of contrast, the WER model is static, since it simply measures the textual discrepancy between that which was written and spoken.

of cattle that are descended from the original Spanish stock left along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts of Florida, Georgia, Mississippi and Alabama by the Spanish explorers in the early 16th century.
The breed was historically cultivated by the Florida crackers, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi.
The cattle bred without human interference in the brushy wooded terrain of the Gulf Coast.
They developed natural resistance to disease and are able to forage on marginal vegetation.
Spanish explorers in the 1490s and 16th century brought to the new world breeding stock of small, hardy cattle which were able to survive the sea crossing.
Some were released deliberately, trusting that their survival instincts would allow them to survive and reproduce.
Thus months or years later a ready food source would be available.
In time, these Spanish cattle acquired different names from the localities where they were concentrated.
The name pineywoods was derived from their location in the Pineywoods of southern Mississippi.
The Pineywoods survived and adapted to their new home.

Propafenone is a class 1C anti-arrhythmic medication, which treats illnesses associated with rapid heart beats such as atrial and ventricular arrhythmias.
Propafenone works by slowing the influx of sodium ions into the cardiac muscle cells, causing a decrease in excitability of the cells.
Propafenone differs from the prototypical class Ic antiarrhythmic in that it has additional activity as a beta-adrenergic blocker which can cause bradycardia and bronchospasm.
Propafenone is metabolized primarily in the liver.
Because of its short half-life, it requires dosing two or three times daily to maintain steady blood levels.
The long-term safety of propafenone is unknown.
Because it is structurally similar to another anti-arrhythmic medicine, flecainide, similar cautions should be exercised in its use.
Flecainide and propafenone, like other antiarrhythmic drugs have been shown to increase the occurrence of arrhythmias , primarily in patients with underlying heart disease.
However, their use in structurally normal hearts is considered safe.

Maternal feminism is the belief of many early feminists that women as mothers and caregivers had an important but distinctive role to play in society and in politics.
It incorporates reform ideas from social feminism, and combines the concepts of maternalism and feminism.
The concept was attacked by later feminists as accepting the paternalist view of society and providing an excuse for inequality.
Christina Hoff Sommers, a critic of late 20th century feminism, has defined maternal feminism as a "recognition that the sexes are equal but different.
Wollstonecraft thought, "men and women were essentially the same in their spirits and souls, deserving of the same rights.
" According to Sommers, "Hannah [More] met women where they were.
She believed there was a feminine nature and that women were caring and nurturing, different from men but deserving of equality.
" More was very popular in her day, but if she is remembered now it is for accepting and rationalizing the patriarchal system of her day.
The conservative English authors Frances Trollope and Elizabeth Gaskell both thought that women should be better educated so they would be less dependent on men.
Trollope thought that financially secure women should go beyond providing moral education to their children, and should express in public their maternal values, social concerns and caring outlook.
Her novels repeatedly show how a young heroine can improve a corrupt society through her moral influence.

The flexbone formation is a predominant running formation derived from the wishbone formation and it features a quarterback under center with a fullback lined up directly behind the quarterback.
There are two smaller running backs called slotbacks aligned behind the line of scrimmage on each side of the offensive line.

The basic play run from the flexbone is known as a triple option, or veer.
Often the quarterback first sends one of the slotbacks in motion to the other side.
While he is still in motion behind the fullback, the quarterback then receives the ball from the center.
Next, the fullback either takes the football from the quarterback or 'fakes' that he has taken the football.
If the fullback takes the football, then he runs straight into the line of scrimmage and attempts to gain yardage.

Also called PZT, it is a ceramic perovskite material that shows a marked piezoelectric effect, meaning that the compound changes shape when an electric field is applied.
It is used in a number of practical applications such as ultrasonic transducers and piezoelectric resonators.
It is a white to off-white solid.
PZT was first developed around 1952 at the Tokyo Institute of Technology.
Compared to barium titanate, a previously discovered metallic oxide-based piezoelectric material, PZT exhibit greater sensitivity and has a higher operating temperature.
Due to its physical strength, chemical inertness, tailorability, and relatively low manufacture costs, it is one of the most commonly used piezo ceramics used in the industry.
The relative permittivity of PZT can range from 300 to 3850, depending upon orientation and doping.
Being pyroelectric, this material develops a voltage difference across two of its faces under changing temperature conditions; consequently, PZT can be used as a heat sensor.
PZT is also ferroelectric, which means that it has a spontaneous electric polarization that can be reversed in the presence of an electric field.

Tursiannotko is a Late Iron Age dwelling site located in Pirkkala, Finland.
It's estimated that the dwelling site was inhabited at the beginning of the Viking Age.
While some individual finds have been dated to as early as the 5th century, there are no structural remains supporting that early habitation.
The excavations have uncovered remains of 3-5 houses that were dated from Late Iron Age to 13th century.
The only house that has been completely excavated is one-roomed log cabin, that was built on top of a clay flooring.
Radiocarbon dating has dated the cabin to the 9th or 10th century, being from the beginning or mid Viking Age.
During the excavation, a foundation for possible stove was found inside the cabin, which would make it the oldest dated stove found in Finland.
Another cabin that has been partially excavated was dated to the 11th or 12th century, meaning the Late Vaking Age or Early Crusade Age.
Due to the suitable soil conditions, Tursiannotko bone artifacts have preserved exceptionally well in contrary to other archaeological sites in Finland.
As of 2017, 1560 excavated bone fragments have been identified, the most common animal being pig.

An experience point is a unit of measurement used in tabletop role-playing games and role-playing video games to quantify a player character's progression through the game.
Experience points are generally awarded for the completion of missions, overcoming obstacles and opponents, and for successful role-playing.
In many RPGs, characters start as fairly weak and untrained.
When a sufficient amount of experience is obtained, the character "levels up", achieving the next stage of character development.
Such an event usually increases the character's statistics, such as maximum health, magic and strength, and may permit the character to acquire abilities or improve existing ones.
Leveling up may also give the character access to more areas or items.
improve characters in discrete experience levels; in other games, such as GURPS and the World of Darkness games, experience points are spent on specific abilities or attributes chosen by the player.
In most games, as the difficulty of the challenge increases, the experience rewarded for overcoming it also increases.
As players gain more experience points, the amount of experience needed to gain abilities typically increases.
Alternatively, games keep the amount of experience points per level constant, but progressively lower the experience gained for the same tasks as the character's level increases.
Thus, as the player character strengthens from gaining experience, they are encouraged to accept tasks that are commensurate with their improved abilities in order to advance.

Balcraig Castle stood on the western flank of Hatton Hill about half a mile south of the village of Newtyle, Angus, in the Sidlaw Hills.
Today no evidence remains of the structure save an area levelled off in the top left corner of the field in which it once stood.

In 1317 King Robert the Bruce rewarded Sir William Oliphant, Lord of Aberdalgie with a number of grants of land including Gasknes, Newtyle, Kinpurnie, Auchtertyre, Balcrais, Muirhouse and Hazelhead.
It is not known when the castle of Balcraig was constructed but it was superseded in 1575 when Hatton Castle was erected by the 4th Lord Oliphant nearby.
The only known representation of Balcraig is in Timothy Pont's map of the area circa 1590, when it was still standing.
The size of the stones suggested that they were the foundations of a stone fortalice.
There is also a diary record of the blowing up of the castle at Newtyle.

Numerical weather prediction uses mathematical models of the atmosphere and oceans to predict the weather based on current weather conditions.
Though first attempted in the 1920s, it was not until the advent of computer simulation in the 1950s that numerical weather predictions produced realistic results.
f global and regional forecast models are run in different countries worldwide, using current weather observations relayed from radiosondes, weather satellites and other observing systems as inputs.
ame physical principles can be used to generate either short-term weather forecasts or longer-term climate predictions; the latter are widely applied for understanding and projecting climate change.
ant improvements in tropical cyclone track and air quality forecasts; however, atmospheric models perform poorly at handling processes that occur in a relatively constricted area, such as wildfires.
Manipulating the vast datasets and performing the complex calculations necessary to modern numerical weather prediction requires some of the most powerful supercomputers in the world.
Even with the increasing power of supercomputers, the forecast skill of numerical weather models extends to only about six days.
Factors affecting the accuracy of numerical predictions include the density and quality of observations used as input to the forecasts, along with deficiencies in the numerical models themselves.
Post-processing techniques such as model output statistics have been developed to improve the handling of errors in numerical predictions.
A more fundamental problem lies in the chaotic nature of the partial differential equations that govern the atmosphere.

A year later the SDP withdrew its support of the government resulting in its fall and an early election.
Slobodan Lalović became the Minister of Labour, Employment and Social Policy in the minority government of Vojislav Koštunica.
In August 2005 the SDP refused to support the proposed pension and oil industry laws.
As a result two of its deputies stopped supporting the government.
Ljilja Nestorović and Meho Omerović went into opposition, while the third, Slobodan Lalović kept his post, subsequently withdrawing from the party and becoming an independent deputy.
In 2004 the Democratic Alternative , led by Nebojša Čović, merged into the SDP and assumed leadership over the party.
Solar chemical refers to a number of possible processes that harness solar energy by absorbing sunlight in a chemical reaction.
r to photosynthesis in plants, which converts solar energy into the chemical bonds of glucose molecules, but without using living organisms, which is why it is also called artificial photosynthesis.
A promising approach is to use focused sunlight to provide the energy needed to split water into its constituent hydrogen and oxygen in the presence of a metallic catalyst such as zinc.
This is normally done in a two-step process so that hydrogen and oxygen are not produced in the same chamber, which creates an explosion hazard.
Another approach involves taking the hydrogen created in this process and combining it with carbon dioxide to create methane.
The benefit of this approach is that there is an established infrastructure for transporting and burning methane for power generation, which is not true for hydrogen.
f these approaches is common to most methods of energy storage: adding an extra step between energy collection and electricity production drastically decreases the efficiency of the overall process.
It is also possible to use solar light to directly drive industrial chemical reactions and applications, eliminating the need to burn fossil fuels for energy.
As early as 1909, the dimerization of anthracene into dianthracene was investigated as a means of storing solar energy, as well as the photodimerization of the naphthalene series.
In the 70’s and 80’s a fuel had been made from another reversible chemical, the norbornadiene to quadricyclane transformation cycle, but this failed because the reversal process had a low potential.
Ruthenium-based molecules were also attempted, but this was dismissed because ruthenium is both rare and too heavy of a material.
Henryk Hoser is a Polish prelate of the Catholic Church.
On May 24, 2008, Pope Benedict XVI appointed him to head Roman Catholic Diocese of Warszawa-Praga.
He is a member of the Presidium of the Polish Episcopal Conference and heads the Team of Experts on Bioethics.
Bishop Hoser is a staunch opponent of in vitro fertilisation.
On 11 February 2017, Pope Francis named Bishop Hoser his special envoy to Medjugorje, tasked with assessing the pastoral needs of that place of pilgrimage.
He was explicitly tasked by the Pope to assess the pastoral situation and not the doctrinal situation which was done by Cardinal Ruini.
However he made it clear that he thought very highly of the Medjugorje phenomenon.
erred to as partial colour blindness, is an inherited condition in which people have full trichromatic colour vision, but do not make the same colour matches as the majority of the human population.
It is much more common than dichromacy or other forms of colour blindness, affecting about 6% of human males in Northern European populations.
Two forms are common, known as protanomaly and deuteranomaly.
n order to match a given spectral yellow light, protanomalous observers need more red light in a redgreen anomalies, but with appropriate choices of colours to mix, tritanomaly can also be measured.

Uintatherium is an extinct genus of herbivorous mammal that lived during the Eocene epoch.
insperatus of Middle to Late Eocene China.
Uintatherium was a large browsing animal.
70 m , and a weight up to 2 tonnes, it was similar to today's rhinoceros, both in size and in shape, although they are not closely related.
Its legs were robust to sustain the weight of the animal and were equipped with claws.
Moreover, a Uintathere's sternum was made up of horizontal segments, unlike today's rhinos, which have compressed vertical segments.
he skull, which is both large and strongly built, but simultaneously flat and concave: this feature is rare and, apart from some brontotheres, not regularly characteristic of any other known mammal.
Its cranial cavity was exceptionally small due the walls of the cranium being exceedingly thick.
The weight of the skull was mitigated by numerous sinuses permeating the walls of the cranium, like those in an elephant's skull.
The large upper canine teeth might have served as formidable defensive weapons, and superficially resembled those of saber-toothed cats.
r Canyon is a large canyon formed by the Snake River in the Magic Valley region of southern Idaho, forming part of the boundary between Twin Falls County to the south and Jerome County to the north.
25 miles wide, and runs for just over 50 miles.
Perrine Bridge crosses the canyon immediately north of the city of Twin Falls.
Shoshone Falls is located approximately 5 miles east of Perrine Bridge along the canyon.
Perrine and others founded the Magic Valley's first successful agricultural operations on the Snake River Canyon floor.
The canyon's value as a farming area diminished after irrigation projects made agriculture practical in the surrounding areas in the early 20th Century.
Today the canyon floor is a tourist attraction and features several parks and golf courses.
In the past it was generally believed the Snake River Canyon was created by a cataclysmic flood caused by water released from Lake Bonneville approximately 15,000 years ago.
However, as of 2000, geologists believe that while the canyon was shaped by the flood, its basic structure predated it.
The canyon is well known as the site of an unsuccessful 1974 attempt by Evel Knievel to jump across it in the Skycycle X-2 rocket.

A police notebook, pocket notebook or PNB is a notebook used by police officers in the United Kingdom to officially record details and incidents while on patrol.
y a number of guidelines, as information entered into an officer's PNB is admissible in court, and the officer will use it to refresh his memory while giving evidence, and to support his statements.
Not all police officers are required to use PNBs; those in administrative roles are not required to maintain them.
Nor are officers working on custody stations, or those involved in training.
Each PNB is issued to an officer by a supervisor, and they are each marked by a particular code which is logged next to that officer's name.
While the guidelines for maintaining a PNB will differ from force to force, there are several common policies on using the notebooks.
In the United Kingdom the use of the PNBs is dictated by the 2000 Freedom of Information Act.
All PNBs are subject to the same rules of disclosure as other confidential documents, and must contain everything deemed relevant to police work.
Each new entry is marked with the day and date in capital letters, and is ended with a line covering the entire width of the page, along with the officer's signature.

The energy value of coal, or the fuel content, is the amount of potential energy in coal that can be converted into actual heating ability.
The value can be calculated and compared with different grades of coal or even other materials.
Materials of different grades will produce differing amounts of heat for a given mass.
While chemistry provides methods of calculating the heating value of a certain amount of a substance, there is a difference between this theoretical value and its application to real coal.
Chemical composition of the coal is defined in terms of its proximate and ultimate analyses.
The parameters of proximate analysis are moisture, volatile matter, ash, and fixed carbon.
Elemental or ultimate analysis encompasses the quantitative determination of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur and oxygen within the coal.
nally, specific physical and mechanical properties of coal and particular carbonization properties The calorific value Q of coal [kJ/kg] is the heat liberated by its complete combustion with oxygen.
Q is a complex function of the elemental composition of the coal.

The Overall Position is a tertiary entrance rank used in the Australian state of Queensland for selection into universities.
ike similar systems used throughout the rest of Australia, the OP shows how well a student has performed in their senior secondary studies compared with all other OP-eligible students in Queensland.
The OP is calculated and used similarly to the Australian Tertiary Admission Rank in other states.
Instead of being a percentile rank , however, OPs are measured on a scale from 1 to 25, where 1 is the highest and 25 is the lowest.
In 2018, 733 students received an OP1, according to Minister for Education and Minister for Industrial Relations Grace Grace.
A table is produced in conjunction with other tertiary authorities to allow conversion between Overall Position, ATAR, Universities Admission Index, SAT, and the A-Level scales.
The Overall Position ranking is due to be replaced by the ATAR ranking in 2019 in line with other Australian states and territories.
A landmark feature of this system is that all assessment is set and marked internally within schools, subject to QCAA approval.

"God of the gaps" is a theological perspective in which gaps in scientific knowledge are taken to be evidence or proof of God's existence.
The "gaps" usage was made by Christian theologians not to discredit theism but rather to point out the fallacy of relying on teleological arguments for God's existence.
Some use the phrase as a criticism of theological positions, to mean that God is used as a spurious explanation for anything not currently explained by science.

The paper negative process consists of using a negative printed on paper to create the final print of a photograph, as opposed to using a modern negative on a film base of cellulose acetate.
The plastic acetate negative enables the printing of a very sharp image intended to be as close a representation of the actual subject as is possible.
ative based on paper instead, there is the possibility of creating a more ethereal image, simply by using a paper with a very visible grain, or by drawing on the paper or distressing it in some way.
One of the original forms of photography was based on the paper negative process.
re", used a negative created on paper treated with silver salts, which was exposed in a camera obscura to create the negative and then contact printed on a similar paper to produce a positive image.
Through the years afterwards, however, better and more accurate ways of producing exact replicas of nature were developed, and these processes relegated the paper negative process to obsolescence.
The process of the paper negative is still relevant, though, in the realm of alternative-process photography.
raphers employing alternative processes reject the idea of the exact replica of nature and seek to use the inherent inexactness of antiquated processes to create a more personal and emotional image.
The paper negative is an extremely versatile process that allows all manner of reworking and retouching of an image, and is the perfect medium to bridge the gap between camera operator and artist.
induction is a basic law of electromagnetism predicting how a magnetic field will interact with an electric circuit to produce an electromotive force —a phenomenon called electromagnetic induction.
It is the fundamental operating principle of transformers, inductors, and many types of electrical motors, generators and solenoids.
always accompanies a time-varying magnetic field, while Faraday's law states that there is EMF on the conductive loop when the magnetic flux through the surface enclosed by the loop varies in time.
Historically, Faraday's law had been discovered and one aspect of it was formulated as the Maxwell–Faraday equation later.
Faraday was the first to publish the results of his experiments.
iscovered properties of electromagnets, he expected that when current started to flow in one wire, a sort of wave would travel through the ring and cause some electrical effect on the opposite side.
He plugged one wire into a galvanometer, and watched it as he connected the other wire to a battery.
Indeed, he saw a transient current when he connected the wire to the battery, and another when he disconnected it.

The Social Law Library, founded in 1803, is the second oldest law library in the United States.
It is located in the John Adams Courthouse at Pemberton Square in Boston, Massachusetts, the same building which houses the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and the Massachusetts Appeals Court.
The history of the library is very much bound up in the history of the Supreme Judicial Court itself.
the Federalists, who wanted to see the common law received into the newly formed United States, and the Jeffersonians, who preferred to have a civil law-based system similar to the Napoleonic Code.
The Federalists, who were prominent in Boston and integral to the library's founding, began importing English law books for local lawyers to use.
The Supreme Judicial Court, needing a law library for their own use, permitted the library to be moved into the Court's offices in exchange for access to its many volumes.
This turn of events allowed the public greater access to the decisions of the courts of Massachusetts, and in turn popularized the common law legal system in the United States.

lso known as the Fourth Turning theory or simply the Fourth Turning, which was created by authors William Strauss and Neil Howe, describes a theorized recurring generation cycle in American history.
Each generational persona unleashes a new era in which a new social, political, and economic climate exists.
Turnings tend to last around 20–22 years.
During this recovery, institutions and communitarian values are strong.
nerational archetypes attack and weaken institutions in the name of autonomy and individualism, which ultimately creates a tumultuous political environment that ripens conditions for another crisis.
In their 1997 book The Fourth Turning, the authors expanded the theory to focus on a fourfold cycle of generational types and recurring mood eras in American history.

25 m across and is brownish above and light-colored below.
Longnose stingrays feed mainly on bottom-dwelling invertebrates and small bony fishes.
Reproduction is aplacental viviparous, with females bearing two litters of 1–2 pups per year.
The young are born in relatively fresh water, move into saltier water as juveniles, and then back into fresher water as adults.
This species is valued by commercial and recreational fishers in many parts of its range, and utilized for meat, gelatin, oil, and even the aquarium trade.
However, the International Union for Conservation of Nature presently lacks enough specific information on these activities to assess its conservation status.

Yr Hen Ogledd , in English the Old North, is the region of Northern England and the southern Scottish Lowlands inhabited by the Celtic Britons of sub-Roman Britain in the Early Middle Ages.
Its denizens spoke a variety of the Brittonic language known as Cumbric.
eople of the Hen Ogledd were the same Brittonic stock as the Picts, Welsh and Cornish, and the region loomed large in Welsh literature and tradition for centuries after its kingdoms had disappeared.
kingdoms of the Hen Ogledd were Elmet in western Yorkshire; Gododdin in Lothian and the Scottish Borders; Rheged, centred in Galloway; and Kingdom of Strathclyde, situated around the Firth of Clyde.
Smaller kingdoms or districts included Aeron, Calchfynydd, Eidyn, Lleuddiniawn, and Manaw Gododdin; the last three were evidently parts of Gododdin.
The Angle kingdoms of Deira and Bernicia both had Brittonic-derived names, suggesting they may have been Brittonic kingdoms in origin.
of the Old North except Strathclyde were conquered by Anglo-Saxons and Picts by about 800; Strathclyde was incorporated into the rising Middle Irish-speaking Kingdom of Scotland in the 11th century.
The legacy of the Hen Ogledd remained strong in Wales.
Welsh tradition included genealogies of the Gwŷr y Gogledd, or Men of the North, and several important Welsh dynasties traced their lineage to them.
A number of important early Welsh texts were attributed to the Men of the North, such as Taliesin, Aneirin, Myrddin Wyllt, and the Cynfeirdd poets.
Fareed Armaly is an Arab American artist, curator, author and editor who lives and works in the United States and Berlin, Europe.
n definition of contemporary artistic practice as the medium itself, well-suited towards rendering a contemporary syntax from issues pertaining to a politics of culture, identity and representation.
His initial wider recognition came in relation to 'Kontext Kunst'|| a term coined by a 1993 seminal group exhibition/publication.
ce is methodologically expansive, including a range of interdisciplinary-based exhibitions, collaborative projects as well the longer-term roles and positions within the art institutional framework.
Armaly’s exhibition projects can be described in terms of how they draw together working fields and relations, that connect between different categories of enquiry and methods of exposition.
Their subject is reflected within and constituted through each project’s particular type of scripted construction.
A hallmark of these constructions is that a project 'identity' emerges from a dynamic aggregate.
The attention is drawn from what is 'exhibited' onto the correspondences between them, and renders the effect of perceiving these interweaved associations as the experience itself.
Graphical guiding systems, wall texts and resource publication operate as a dialog, suggesting the constant triangulation of the locus of the artwork.
By offering analytical passages through, more 'situationist' than 'site', these construct rather than illustrate.

In horology, a wheel train is the gear train of a mechanical watch or clock.
e term is used for other types of gear trains, the long history of mechanical timepieces has created a traditional terminology for their gear trains which is not used in other applications of gears.
Watch movements are very standardized, and the wheel trains of most watches have the same parts.
However, the wheel trains of clocks and watches share the same terminology, and are similar enough that they can be described together.
The large gears in timepieces are generally called wheels, the smaller gears they mesh with are called pinions, and the shafts that the wheels and pinions are mounted on are called arbors.
The wheels are mounted between the plates of the movement, with the pivots rotating in holes in the plates.
The pivot holes have semicircular depressions around them, called oil cups, to hold the oil in contact with the shaft by capillary action.
There are several wheel trains in a typical clock or watch.
The going train is the main gear train of the timepiece.

the abrupt cessation of alcohol intake, a process often coupled with substitution of cross-tolerant drugs that have effects similar to the effects of alcohol in order to prevent alcohol withdrawal.
As such, the term "detoxification" may be somewhat of a misnomer since the process need not refer exclusively to the removal of toxic substances from the body.
Detoxification may or may not be indicated depending upon an individual's age, medical status, and history of alcohol intake.
For example, a young man who binge drinks and seeks treatment one week after his last use of alcohol may not require detoxification before beginning treatment for alcoholism.
Benzodiazepines are the most common family of drugs used for alcohol detoxification, followed by barbiturates.
Benzodiazepines such as chlordiazepoxide , diazepam , lorazepam or oxazepam are the most commonly used drugs used to reduce alcohol withdrawal symptoms.
There are several treatment patterns in which it is used.
The first option takes into consideration the varying degrees of tolerance.
In it, a standard dose of the benzodiazepine is given every half-hour until light sedation is reached.
Once a baseline dose is determined, the medication is tapered over the ensuing 3–10 days.

ay in the Sydney area and the publication of the comprehensive Bradfield plan for expansion of the metropolitan railways, there were a number of other proposed railway schemes which did not proceed.
of the Illawarra railway considered a route continuing south from Kogarah, crossing the George's River at Taren Point, then turning southwest to climb the gradual slope from the river to Sutherland.
f Sutherland Shire meant the railway had to take an indirect route via Hurstville, which necessitated the high-level crossing of George's River at Como, and the steep climb from there to Sutherland.
Following the extension of the Belmore railway to Bankstown in 1909, it was intended to continue this line west in a direct line to meet the Main Southern line at Liverpool.
Due to the rural nature of this area and the likely consequent low patronage levels, there was no great rush to construct this line.
John Bradfield, engineer and designer of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, had a grand vision for Sydney's railway system that has only been partly fulfilled.
oining the New South Wales Public Works Department in 1891, he submitted a report in 1915 calling for the electrification of the suburban railways, a city underground railway and the Harbour Bridge.
World War I led to the collapse of all three proposals, and it was not until 1922 that the Bridge Bill passed through parliament, and 1923 until the first sod was turned on the city railway.

The combine grain yield monitor is a device coupled with other sensors to calculate and record the crop yield or grain yield as a modern-day combine harvester operates.
Yield monitors are a part of the precision agriculture products available to producers today that provide producers with the tools to reduce costs, increase yields, and increase efficiency.
The present day grain yield monitor is designed to measure the harvested grain mass flow, moisture content, and speed to determine total grain harvested.
In most cases today this is coupled with global positioning system to record yield and other spatially variable information across a field.
This allows for the creation of a grain yield map which provides information on spatial variability and supports management decisions for producers.
Grain Mass flow is most commonly measured using a load cell with an impact plate attached to the load cell located at the top of the clean grain elevator.
in elevator paddles rotate around the top of the clean grain elevator, the grain is expelled from the elevator by centrifugal force and makes contact with the impact plate attached to the load cell.
The force applied by the grain is converted to an electrical signal by the load cell that is used to estimate the mass flow of the grain.

When in 413 BC, Athens supported the rebel Amorges in Caria, Darius II would not have responded had not the Athenian power been broken in the same year at Syracuse.
As a result of that event, Darius II gave orders to his satraps in Asia Minor, Tissaphernes and Pharnabazus, to send in the overdue tribute of the Greek towns and to begin a war with Athens.

Bellsybabble is a fictional language of the Devil, which he makes up as he goes along.
alled Bellsybabble which he makes up himself as he goes along but when he is very angry he can speak quite bad French very well though some who have heard him say that he has a strong Dublin accent.
The name "Bellsybabble" is a pun on Beelzebub, "babble" and Babel.
Bellsybabble has variously been called a poly-language, a pluridialectal idiom and a ludic creation.
For Giorgio Melchiori, it is suggestive of the idea that in literary texts, there is not a single language, but a multitude of languages, a different one for each reader of the text.
George Sandulescu's study of Finnegans Wake, entitled The Language of the Devil.
Linguist John Haiman compares Bellsybabble to ordinary language in the way it continually shapes, and is in turn shaped by, the utterances spoken within it.
This challenges the rigid separation between code and message.
On one hand, the language determines the presupposed content and boundaries of possible messages, as shown by the concept of linguistic relativity.
On the other hand, the message may also affect the code used by that very message.

A Usenet newsgroup is a repository usually within the Usenet system, for messages posted from many users in different locations using Internet.
Newsgroups are technically distinct from, but functionally similar to, discussion forums on the World Wide Web.
Newsreader software is used to read the content of newsgroups.
Before the adoption of the World Wide Web, Usenet newsgroups were among the most popular Internet services, and have retained their noncommercial nature in contrast to the increasingly ad-laden web.
recent years, this form of open discussion on the Internet has lost considerable ground to individually-operated browser-accessible forums and big media social networks such as Facebook and Twitter.
Communication is facilitated by the Network News Transfer Protocol which allows connection to Usenet servers and data transfer over the internet.

The Evening Telegraph was for most of its existence Ireland's leading evening newspaper.
Its main rivals were the widely read Dublin Evening Mail and the less widely read Evening Herald.
The Evening Telegraph was launched in 1871 by a former Irish nationalist Lord Mayor of Dublin Edmund Dwyer Gray.
The newspaper was unavowedly Irish nationalist in its politics.
It was particularly famous for the attention it paid to covering social events, and for its use of drawings as illustrations.

A stud finder is a handheld device used with wood buildings to locate framing studs located behind the final walling surface, usually drywall.
While there are many different stud finders available, most fall into two main categories: magnetic stud detectors and electric stud finders.
Some newer technologies exist such as RF radar with 3D imaging technology.
Stud finders have been in use since the early 20th century, and the first ones were all magnetic, relying on internal magnets to detect the walling fasteners presumably attached to studs.
In 1977, Robert Franklin designed a revolutionary electronic stud finder that relied on an internal capacitor to measure changes in density behind the walling.
While novel, these electronic stud finders did not always prove effective in locating studs.
Since 1998, many developments and improvements have been made to the internal capacitor stud finders and increased their popularity.
Recent innovators developed stud finders with multiple sensor plates that sense the wall in multiple places instantly.
These sensors can indicate the location, width, and lack of studs simultaneously.

The bandit corydoras or false bandit catfish is a tropical freshwater fish belonging to the Corydoradinae sub-family of the Callichthyidae family.
It originates in inland waters in South America, and is found in the upper Rio Negro and Meta River basins in Brazil and Colombia.
It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter.
It lays eggs in dense vegetation and adults do not guard the eggs.
The female holds 2-4 eggs between her pelvic fins, where the male fertilizes them for about 30 seconds.
Only then does the female swim to a suitable spot, where she attaches the very sticky eggs.
The pair repeats this process until about 100 eggs have been fertilized and attached.
The bandit corydoras is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry.

A pilot model was not delivered to the UK by 1944 by which time the British Churchill tank had been in service for two years and greatly improved over its initial model.
The T14 project never came to fruition due to this fact.
US efforts working on a similarly well-armoured tank but with a higher speed for use other than in infantry support led to the T20 Medium Tank.
In 1941, the head of the United States Ordnance Department travelled to Britain to learn of their experience, ideas and requirements for the future.
Among the discussion was the possibility of designing a well-armed and armoured combat vehicle, one that was stronger than the British Churchill infantry tank then in production.
or a US 75 mm gun and share many parts with the M4 Sherman; they had the same armour thickness, but with sloped armour at extreme angles, effective armour on the T14 was greatly increased to 101 mm.

Testing of the pilot model which was completed in 1944 showed the vehicle to be much too heavy for practical use.
By this time, the British Army was satisfied with the Churchill and its cruiser tank designs and further production of the T14 was halted.
Only two were built; one tested in the US and the other sent to Britain.

Some modern economic commentators argue the Kuznets swing reflects an 18-year cycle in land values.
Howrey claimed that the apparent business cycle found by Kuznets was an artifact of the filter Kuznets used.
Howrey suggested that the same cyclical pattern could be found in white noise series when the Kuznets filter was applied.
However, Kuznets claims swings can be found in the world GDP dynamics even without the application of the Kuznets filter.

d without any operations that might change when extending the field F , notably without factoring polynomials, this shows that whether two matrices are similar does not change upon field extensions.
The form is named after German mathematician Ferdinand Georg Frobenius.
Some authors use the term rational canonical form for a somewhat different form that is more properly called the primary rational canonical form.
Instead of decomposing into a minimal number of cyclic subspaces, the primary form decomposes into a maximal number of cyclic subspaces.
This article mainly deals with the form that does not require factorization, and explicitly mentions "primary" when the form using factorization is meant.
and B are similar, one approach is to try, for each of them, to decompose the vector space as far as possible a direct sum of stable subspaces, and compare the respective actions on these subspaces.
For instance if both are diagonalizable, then one can take the decomposition into eigenspaces , and then similarity can be decided by comparing eigenvalues and their multiplicities.
While in practice this is often a quite insightful approach, there are various drawbacks this has as a general method.
First, it requires finding all eigenvalues, say as roots of the characteristic polynomial, but it may not be possible to give an explicit expression for them.

Buccal pumping is "breathing with one's cheeks": a method of ventilation used in respiration in which the animal moves the floor of its mouth in a rhythmic manner that is externally apparent.
It is the sole means of inflating the lungs in amphibians.
There are two methods of buccal pumping, defined by the number of movements of the floor of the mouth needed to complete both inspiration and expiration.
Four-stroke buccal pumping is used by some basal ray-finned fish and aquatic amphibians such as Xenopus and Amphiuma.
This method has several stages.
These will be described for an animal starting with lungs in a deflated state: First, the glottis is closed, and the nostrils are opened.
The floor of the mouth is then depressed , drawing air in.
The nostrils are then closed, the glottis opened, and the floor of mouth raised, forcing the air into the lungs for gas exchange.
To deflate the lungs, the process is reversed.
Two-stroke buccal pumping completes the process more quickly, as is seen in most extant amphibians.

In mathematics, the L-functions of number theory are expected to have several characteristic properties, one of which is that they satisfy certain functional equations.
There is an elaborate theory of what these equations should be, much of which is still conjectural.
In every case this relates to some value ζ that is only defined by analytic continuation from the infinite series definition.
Therefore, use of the functional equation is basic, in order to study the zeta-function in the whole complex plane.
Z\,} where Z is ζ multiplied by a gamma-factor, involving the gamma function.
This is now read as an 'extra' factor in the Euler product for the zeta-function, corresponding to the infinite prime.

Substances that are removed during the process of drinking water treatment include suspended solids, bacteria, algae, viruses, fungi, and minerals such as iron and manganese.
n removing the contaminants include physical processes such as settling and filtration, chemical processes such as disinfection and coagulation and biological processes such as slow sand filtration.

Many small ball lineups feature a non-traditional center who offers skills that are not normally found from players at that position.
Teams often move a physically dominant player who would typically play the small forward position into the power forward position.
Examples of players who have been used in this role include Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, and LeBron James.
That individual would play alongside either a traditional power forward , or alongside a center.
The advantage of using small ball is that the power forward position is occupied by a faster, more agile player who can outrun and outmaneuver the opposing power forward.
In many cases the player may have a better three-point shooting percentage than a traditional power forward, which can help spread the opposition defense.
The opposing defender will come out to mark the player on the perimeter of the three point line, allowing space for teammates to run in and score around the basket.

In chemistry, regioselectivity is the preference of one direction of chemical bond making or breaking over all other possible directions.
ch of many possible positions a reagent will affect, such as which proton a strong base will abstract from an organic molecule, or where on a substituted benzene ring a further substituent will add.
A specific example is a halohydrin formation reaction with 2-propenylbenzene:Because of the preference for the formation of one product over another, the reaction is selective.
This reaction is regioselective because it selectively generates one constitutional isomer rather than the other.
Various examples of regioselectivity have been formulated as rules for certain classes of compounds under certain conditions, many of which are named.
udents are Markovnikov's rule for the addition of protic acids to alkenes, and the Fürst-Plattner rule for the addition of nucleophiles to derivatives of cyclohexene, especially epoxide derivatives.
Regioselectivity in ring-closure reactions is subject to Baldwin's rules.
If there are two or more orientations that can be generated during a reaction, one of them is dominant Regioselectivity can also be applied to specific reactions such as addition to pi ligands.
Selectivity also occurs in carbene insertions, for example in the Baeyer-Villiger reaction.
In this reaction, an oxygen is regioselectively inserted near an adjacent carbonyl group.

IberiaBank is an FDIC-insured institution regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
On March 31, 2009, as the financial crisis came to an end, IberiaBank became the first financial institution in the country to repay its TARP funds to the Treasury.
The bank opened its doors on March 12, 1887 as a savings and loan association under the name Iberia Building Association.
The name originates from New Iberia, LA, which dates back to 1779 when Spanish conquerors named their newly settled "Nueva Iberia" after the Iberian Peninsula.
At the time the bank was founded, New Iberia was a farming community of about 3,000 people.
Its principal industry was sugarcane farming, as the area's oil reserves, which would later spur population and economic growth, had yet to be discovered.
For its first 100 years, the bank's main functions were taking deposits and making home mortgage loans in the New Iberia community.
Since savings and loan associations, or "thrifts," could not lend to businesses, ISLA was not affected by the oil crisis in the early 1980s like many Louisiana commercial banks were.
After regulations preventing thrifts from expanding eased in 1985, the bank absorbed several struggling during the 1980s oil glut.
Branches opened in Morgan City and Franklin, LA, moving the thrift beyond Iberia Parish for the first time.

Trisoxazolines are a class of tridentate, chiral ligands composed of three oxazoline rings.
Despite being neutral they are able to form stable complexes with high oxidation state metals, such as rare earths, due to the chelate effect.
The ligands have been investigated for molecular recognition and their complexes are used in asymmetric catalysts and polymerisation.
Trisoxazolines can either be synthesised directly, from suitable tripodal starting materials, or built up in a modular manner.
ral ligands with C3 rotational symmetry and the modular approach typically being used to give asymmetric compounds , which are either heterochiral or possess a mix of both chiral and achiral groups.
s in symmetry can significantly effect the coordination chemistry of the ligands and the catalytic activity of their complexes, with C3 symmetric ligands often being better for asymmetric catalysis.
Suitable tripodal compounds, such as trimesic acid and nitrilotriacetic acid, can be converted directly to trisoxazolines.
The simplicity of this approach is beneficial, however it only allows a limited variety of structures to be produced, due to the limited range of available starting materials.
Modular synthesis allows for a more diverse range of structures, however the multi-step reactions can result in lower overall yields.
